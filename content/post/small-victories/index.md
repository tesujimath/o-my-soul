O my soul,

How is it that the smallest things are in fact the most important?

Let's notice something in Jesus' letter to the church in Pergamum.

{{< quote source="Revelation 2:12-13" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.

‚Äú‚ÄòI know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äô‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

The city of Pergamum was dominated by worship of pagan deities and so the church there was right in the thick of the spiritual battle. But doesn't Jesus' commendation seem to be of such a small thing? Simply holding fast his name? Is that all?

Let's not underestimate what such apparently small things are ultimately all about.

In the context of forgiving a brother in Christ who has caused much pain, Paul writes this.

{{< quote source="2 Corinthians 2:9" url="/ref/2-corinthians" >}}
For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, are you obedient in everything? Even in apparently small things? Let's consider just one such. Recall something Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:27-28" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Is this not an area which requires honest self-evaluation and ruthless self-discipline? And isn't this precisely one of these apparently small things?

Consider. As you drive through the student quarter on a balmy summer afternoon, are you noticing the oh-so-attractive and rather scantily clad students parading themselves? And what do your eyes do then? And where do your thoughts take you?

Do you think it doesn't matter what your eyes are doing, because no-one sees? And where your thoughts are taking you, because no-one knows? It matters! Our Heavenly Father sees and our Heavenly Father knows. The choice between looking to the left or looking to the right is in fact the choice between disobedience and disrespect, or personal holiness and an act of worship. An act of worship to the one who loves you. The one who rescued you. The one who grieves over the vestigial sin in your life. O my soul, choose to honour him in this! Make every small victory over sin an act of worship, and keep your eyes to the right!

In the contexts of giving and praying and fasting, Jesus follows up with this.

{{< quote source="Matthew 6:4, 6, 18" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
{{< /quote >}}

David knew this.

{{< quote source="1 Chronicles 28:9a" url="/ref/1-chronicles" >}}
‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought.
{{< /quote >}}

Every plan. Every thought. And the intent behind each and every thought. Every motive which wanted to remain hidden is in fact fully exposed to the Lord who searches all hearts.

And there's more.

{{< quote source="Romans 6:16" url="/ref/romans" >}}
Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
{{< /quote >}}

Holding fast Jesus' name is in truth all about consistency and integrity in the secret heart. Do you realise your character is the product of a thousand seemingly insignificant choices? You simply cannot do one thing and become another.

{{< quote source="Colossians 3:1-4, 17" url="/ref/colossians" >}}
If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, you must also take heed of Jesus' sharp two-edged sword.

{{< quote source="Hebrews 4:12-13" url="/ref/hebrews" >}}
For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
{{< /quote >}}

Finally, notice that Antipas chose martyrdom rather than deny Jesus. And his reward? To bear the same description as of Jesus himself!

{{< quote source="Revelation 1:4-5" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.
{{< /quote >}}

Jesus is the faithful witness and he bestowed upon Antipas the very same title.

O my soul, be ruthlessly consistent in how you approach all these apparently small things, and be Jesus' faithful witness in everything! üôè
