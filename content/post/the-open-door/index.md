O my soul,

How does an open door constitute a reward?

{{< quote source="Revelation 3:7-8a" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‚ÄòThe words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.

‚ÄòI know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.‚Äô
{{< /quote >}}

Among the seven churches only Smyrna was able to join with Philadelphia in being commended by Jesus without reservation. Jesus knew their works. What a joy it must have been for him to commend their faithfulness and to richly reward them. So let's consider the reward of that open door. And let's start by asking, how does that even constitute a reward?

Isn't an open door simply an opportunity presenting itself? Indeed Paul uses exactly this metaphor on several occasions. Here are two examples.

{{< quote source="1 Corinthians 16:8-9" url="/ref/1-corinthians" >}}
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Colossians 4:2-4" url="/ref/colossians" >}}
Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison‚∏∫that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
{{< /quote >}}

Truly the opportunity here was not presenting itself but rather was being presented as a sovereign work of the Lord. Paul was most concerned about the open door for declaring the mystery of Christ, that he may make it clear‚∏∫of course he was. But I am not persuaded that this was the nature of the reward for the Philadelphians.

Perhaps there's a clue in Jesus' next letter.

{{< quote source="Revelation 3:20" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.
{{< /quote >}}

Jesus is not knocking on the Philadelphian door because it is already open and he is right there among them. This is the door to heaven itself, just as John's vision continues.

{{< quote source="Revelation 4:1-3" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‚ÄúCome up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.‚Äù At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
{{< /quote >}}

What a door this is! And it is wide open and cannot be shut. What a reward!

In passing we must enjoy to notice John's ludicrous attempt to describe the indescribable, the one seated on the throne. He who was seated there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. Really? Is that the best he could have done? It tells us nothing. Except of course of the ineffability of the Creator God of the Universe, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. Praise his holy name! And praise his indescribable being!

Before we continue to think about that door, let's consider what was being rewarded, for it seems to be so very little.

{{< quote source="Revelation 3:8b, 10a" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.

Because you have kept my word about patient endurance ...
{{< /quote >}}

And that's the entirety of it! But make no mistake, this is not so very little at all. We need to understand what this means, to keep Jesus' word and not to deny his name. It is in fact about absolute trust and complete surrender and living an uncompromised life which is fully consistent and perfectly aligned with Jesus being Lord of all. And it is about that personal holiness which is an ongoing act of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.

Jesus' name is his character. It is who he is. So what would deny his name? Would it not be anxiety or doubt or inconsistency or pretence or pride or holding anything back?

O my soul, do you understand the magnitude of what was being commended? Marvel at it, and now go and do likewise! And if you think you simply lack the strength to live like this, observe that the Philadelphians also had but little power. The power to live like this is all the Lord's and it is his gift of grace. Praise him!

But back to this open door. Jesus tells us a bit more about it.

{{< quote source="John 10:7-10" url="/ref/john" >}}
So Jesus again said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.
{{< /quote >}}

Jesus is the door, and he is the door to life itself. Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. O my soul, are you starting to understand the magnitude of the Philadelphian reward?

And there is something else which must not be overlooked. What does Jesus say of those who have not lived this pure and holy and surrendered life?

{{< quote source="Revelation 3:9b" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
... and they will learn that I have loved you.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, have you learnt this? Have you learnt that the King of the Universe has loved you with an everlasting love?

And finally, do not overlook that the abundant life is this life!

{{< quote source="Ephesians 3:20-21" url="/ref/ephesians" >}}
Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, live like those Philadelphians, and receive from Jesus the reward of that open door! üôè
