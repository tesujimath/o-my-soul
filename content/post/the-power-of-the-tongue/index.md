O my soul,

How will you be OK?

Here's how.

{{< quote source="Psalm 34:1" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
{{< /quote >}}

Do not underestimate the power of praise for lifting you up, out of discouragement, out of doubt, out of despair, out of the place of being despised and rejected, and into light and truth and grace and personal holiness.

Recall that it was the Apostle Peter who brought us to Psalm 34, writing to those in the midst of suffering.

{{< quote source="1 Peter 3:8-10" url="/ref/1-peter" >}}
Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For

‚ÄúWhoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

In the face of all that is broken and dysfunctional you must bless. You must be a blessing so that you may receive a blessing. So praise the Lord!

And to this end we must acknowledge that the exhortations and the prohibitions are not here without reason. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling. And keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.

So we must address the severe temptation which is ever present for those who are hurting. For those who have been shamefully treated. For those who have been despised and rejected. And that is the temptation to strike back with the tongue.

{{< quote source="Proverbs 18:21" url="/ref/proverbs" >}}
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.
{{< /quote >}}

For those who are hurting this temptation may be severe indeed‚∏∫to strike back with a fatal blow, with words spoken with intent to bring down and to destroy. Isn't bringing down the prideful with carefully chosen words so inviting? Don't they deserve it? Perhaps so, but O my soul, you must not do it!

The psalmist reflected on the ways of the arrogant and the wicked.

{{< quote source="Psalm 73:8-9" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, will _your_ tongue strut through the earth? May it not be so!

{{< quote source="Psalm 34:11-16" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
{{< /quote >}}

Do you see how important it is to bridle the tongue? It is foremost among these exhortations for anyone desiring a life filled with goodness, even ahead of actually doing good and seeking peace.

{{< quote source="Proverbs 10:18" url="/ref/proverbs" >}}
The one who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever utters slander is a fool.
{{< /quote >}}

Concealed hatred poisons and corrupts the one who holds it. It's not that it must be vented, but rather expurgated.

And if you expect or even desire to dwell in the Lord's presence, think on this.

{{< quote source="Psalm 15:1-5" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbour, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honours those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
{{< /quote >}}

O my soul, you have received much grace. Be sure to give much.

James warns at some length about the power of the tongue.

{{< quote source="James 3:9-12" url="/ref/james" >}}
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
{{< /quote >}}

Would you defile your praise with bitterness and gall? May it not be so!

{{< quote source="Proverbs 10:20a" url="/ref/proverbs" >}}
The tongue of the righteous is choice silver.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Proverbs 12:18b" url="/ref/proverbs" >}}
The tongue of the wise brings healing.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Proverbs 15:4a" url="/ref/proverbs" >}}
A gentle tongue is a tree of life.
{{< /quote >}}

A tree of life, no less!

O my soul, death and life are in the power of the tongue, so use yours wisely! üôè
