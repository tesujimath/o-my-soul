There is a [community on Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKILv1dPk0-Q3TXxS3IxEK5ukZmuYUVdCyJ2jmFxj_6N0LEhCjJT_KXvGIOpLutcBLdQ01) for discussion of [O my Soul](/about/) and related matters.

It is a community for those who worship the Christian God of the Bible.  It is a place to find encouragement and affirmation and blessing and healing.  It is a place to be gentle and kind.  It is a safe place for hurting people.  It is a place to reflect on how you have been blessed or encouraged by the writing here, or to share struggles you have experienced in living this out in practice.  It is a place to encourage and affirm one another in these struggles as we journey on for the Lord.

It is not a community for arguing or taking offence at others or for discussion of other gods or other religions.

Anyone on this journey of loving the Lord and surrendering their life to Jesus is welcome to [join the community](https://signal.group/#CjQKILv1dPk0-Q3TXxS3IxEK5ukZmuYUVdCyJ2jmFxj_6N0LEhCjJT_KXvGIOpLutcBLdQ01).
