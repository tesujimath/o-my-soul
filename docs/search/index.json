[{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat are you thinking about?\nAre you thinking again about those insolent ones? And if so, why? Why would you continue to think about them? Thinking about them is not blessing you. Be assured that they are not thinking about you! Or are you dwelling on other things which drag you down? Why would you continue to do that?\nLike a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly.\n‚Äï Proverbs 26:11 O my soul, what are you doing? Would you be building that dam on the river of life? Stop! Stop thinking about those things which drag you down. Stop dwelling on them. Stop living in them. Think instead about something else.\nWhat then? What must you think about? Paul tells us.\nFinally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:8 O my soul, think about these things and be lifted up and encouraged. So what are they, these things that we must think about? Rejoice that they are many and varied, and fill your mind with them.\nThink about whatever is true.\nThen I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.\n‚Äï Revelation 19:11 O my soul, think about this. Here is Jesus in all of his resurrection power and splendour, whose very name is Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war on all that is unholy. And he is victorious. Think about him!\nAnd now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.\n‚Äï 2 Samuel 7:28 The words of the Lord are true. What he has promised is true. His name is Faithful and True. Think about this!\nThink about whatever is just.\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 O my soul, think about this. Christ died on the cross, paying the price for my sin and yours in full. If we confess our sins and cry out to God for mercy it is his justice that demands we be forgiven. The price is paid. He will not take a second payment precisely because he is just. Hallelujah!\nAnd this:\nThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.\nFor I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\n‚Äï Isaiah 61:1,8 O my soul, know that the Lord loves justice. In power and compassion Jesus came to do justice for the poor and the oppressed. Think about this.\nLearn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow\u0026rsquo;s cause.\n‚Äï Isaiah 1:17 Think about how to do justice‚∏∫the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own justice which binds up the brokenhearted and proclaims liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound. Think about how to do this in his Spirit and by his power.\nThink about what is worthy of praise.\nThen I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 5:11-12 Hear the sound of a hundred million angels singing praise to the risen Lord Jesus in his resurrection power and splendour. And hear his own voice.\nThen I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.\nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, ‚ÄúFear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 1:12-18 Fear not, O my soul, and think about this. He is the first and the last and the living one, who died and rose again to life, and he is alive forevermore. Praise him!\nAnd finally, why finally? Why does Paul say finally? We need to look at what came before. And what came before is this.\nDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about those insolent ones or about anything else.\nThink about these true, just, praiseworthy things, O my soul, and pray with thanksgiving, and know that the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-16T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/what-to-think-about/redd-f-LP3PabHuyiE-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_791300_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/what-to-think-about/","title":"What to think about"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWas Joseph\u0026rsquo;s life as God had intended?\nHe was hated by his brothers to the extent that they wanted to murder him. Narrowly escaping death at their hands he was sold into slavery at the age of seventeen and then thrown into prison in Egypt for a crime he didn\u0026rsquo;t commit, where he was incarcerated for more than ten years.\nIs this what God had intended for him? Why had this all happened? Is this what the Lord\u0026rsquo;s perfect plans and purposes look like for those he loves?\nBy no means! We simply must account for human folly and foolishness. Joseph\u0026rsquo;s own life and his whole family were dominated by these.\nNow Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colours. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:3-4 Jacob, now called Israel, fathered Joseph in his old age and doted upon him, unwisely favouring him above his brothers whose subsequent envy grew to become hatred.\nAnd Joseph demonstrated that he was his father\u0026rsquo;s son through his own lack of wisdom.\nJoseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father\u0026rsquo;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:2 At seventeen shouldn\u0026rsquo;t he have known better how to get on with his brothers than telling tales about them to their own father?\nNow Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. He said to them, ‚ÄúHear this dream that I have dreamed: Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.‚Äù His brothers said to him, ‚ÄúAre you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?‚Äù So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:5-8 Joseph\u0026rsquo;s dream was from the Lord and revealed a glorious future. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to that. But this revelation caused his brothers to hate him even more. They hated him even more because he was unwise enough to tell them of that prophecy which did indeed come to pass, eventually. Nevertheless, sharing it with his brothers as he did was both foolish and inflammatory. He was his father\u0026rsquo;s son.\nAnd this was a mistake he repeated.\nThen he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, ‚ÄúBehold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 37:9 Perhaps such things are better kept to one\u0026rsquo;s self.\nLater when he arrived in Egypt as a slave he was equally naive. Let\u0026rsquo;s first notice how this foreign slave without credentials or experience became the trusted overseer of the household of Potiphar, the captain of the guard of the Pharaoh of Egypt.\nThe LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master. His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:2-3 Wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blessing from the Lord all entirely undeserved? Grace and favour were raining down from heaven on this naive young man.\nAnd then he was accused by Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife of attempted rape. But notice again the pattern here. Just as Joseph had been unwise to share that dream with his brothers, so also he was unwise to be in the house alone with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife.\nNow Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. And after a time his master\u0026rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, ‚ÄúLie with me.‚Äù But he refused \u0026hellip;\nAnd as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:6-8, 10 And so it continued day after day. His woeful encounter with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife was not an isolated incident.\nAs soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, ‚ÄúThis is the way your servant treated me,‚Äù his anger was kindled. And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king\u0026rsquo;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:19-20 Joseph again got what he deserved for his own foolishness, didn\u0026rsquo;t he? But what do we find, again?\nBut the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:21 The undeserved steadfast love of the Lord continued to rain down upon him.\nAnd whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:23 Eventually‚∏∫and never was a word so appropriate as here in Joseph\u0026rsquo;s life‚∏∫eventually, Joseph came before Pharaoh himself, in a way which was indeed by the hand of the Lord, interpreted his dream, and was freed to a great and glorious future.\nThen Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSince God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.‚Äù And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSee, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 41:39-41 How ironic. Through those long years of incarceration God had transformed that foolish youth into a man so discerning and wise. What a miracle of grace. Praise the Lord!\nO my soul, you know the rest. Famine in Canaan caused Jacob to send his sons to Egypt to buy food. After some scheming by Joseph which we could see as teaching his brothers a lesson (and who could blame him for that?) there was an emotional reconciliation. And then what?\nThus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.\n‚Äï Genesis 47:27 What is this story all about then? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s incredible rescue of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s family from famine in their own land? Yes, certainly it is that. A family reconciliation after separation caused by hatred and betrayal? Yes, that too. Rescue and restoration of a naive young man from the consequences of his own foolishness? Indeed.\nBut ultimately isn\u0026rsquo;t this in fact all about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for undeserving sinners? A Plan B so good and full of grace it seems to improve upon that hypothetical Plan A which never transpired. This Plan B which was wrought out of folly and foolishness and disappointment and shame.\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 So much had gone wrong, but none of this pain and heartbreak and suffering was intended by the Lord nor attributable to him.\nAnd so it is with us. He is the great rescuer, fully able to pick up the pieces of ruined lives and work all things together for good. His plans and purposes are not thwarted by our mistakes nor by our foolishness. Praise the Lord! And throughout Joseph\u0026rsquo;s story never once did God\u0026rsquo;s grace and steadfast love and faithfulness reach its limit. His grace is sufficient. Yes, the rescue took its time, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t it so well worth the wait?\nRejoice, O my soul, in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for your own ruined life! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-09T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/senjuti-kundu-JfolIjRnveY-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1444207_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/","title":"Plan B"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWould you build a dam across the river of living water? Would you reduce to a trickle that which has been flowing so abundantly? Would you be a busy little beaver, hoarding and assembling your pain and disappointment and cementing it all in place with unforgiveness and resentment? Would you?\nO my soul, know that I do understand why you would want to build your dam. I acknowledge that you have been treated heinously and that you have been brushed aside and disregarded. And I know that you\u0026rsquo;re hurting, really hurting, and from time to time you want to assert that nobody cares. You want to shout it out across the rooftops at the top of your voice: nobody cares. It\u0026rsquo;s a lie, by the way, that nobody cares. For sure, there are some who don\u0026rsquo;t, perhaps several, and others who are only pretending. But there remain those who are loving and kind and faithful and true. Be grateful for them.\nAnd what of those insolent ones whose behaviour has been so heinous‚∏∫those who should care and yet do not? Beware, my soul, of how you regard them in return. This is perilous ground indeed upon which you stand.\nKeep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.\n‚Äï Proverbs 4:23 Keep your heart with all vigilance, O my soul. This means that you must forgive and you must let go of all resentment. You must do these things! And you must not build that dam!\nLet me remind you just what is at stake here.\nOn the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, ‚ÄúIf anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‚ÄòOut of his heart will flow rivers of living water.‚Äô‚Äù Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n‚Äï John 7:37-39 O my soul, do you thirst? Do you thirst for love and wholeness and relational authenticity? Come to Jesus and drink. Believe in him and listen to him. Listen to him in your sorrow and pain and dismay.\n‚ÄúBut I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 5:39 ‚ÄúJudge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 6:37-38 Forgive and you will be forgiven. Extend love and kindness to those who do not, and it will be measured back to you, O my soul, how it will! And rivers of living water will flow out of your heart and you will be a blessing to many.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t the way these insolent ones carry on simply egregious? Yes of course it is, and appallingly so. What\u0026rsquo;s to be done then about their heinous behaviour?\nBe angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4-5 Be angry, O my soul. Be angry and do not sin. Notice it is ‚Äúand‚Äù not ‚Äúbut‚Äù. Interesting! The dam on the river is not made of anger. Was Jesus angry when he cleared the temple? Yes of course he was and rightly so. There is a righteous anger and it is of the Lord. Be angry and do not sin. The behaviour is egregious and it cannot be excused. It can only be forgiven, and this you must do.\nAnd listen to the heart-cry of the Psalmist to the Lord. Make it your own as you put your trust in the Lord.\nDeal bountifully with your servant, that I may live and keep your word. Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.\nYou rebuke the insolent, accursed ones, who wander from your commandments. Take away from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:17-18, 21-22 The Lord himself is the one who rebukes these insolent ones. And there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nThe word of the LORD came to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.\nThus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:1-3,10 And there is good news indeed for these poor sheep.\nI myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:15-16 But beware, O my soul, there is a warning also to these very same sheep.\nIs it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?\nI will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:18,22 What then are we to do? Two things:\nForgive, and you will be forgiven.\n‚Äï Luke 6:37 and:\nIf you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday. And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:10-11 You must do what those insolent ones will not, and then you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water.

No wavering. No second guessing. None at all.\nJesus said \u0026hellip; ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 5:36 Such trust is life and health and strength. Why would anyone not live like this? And yet many do not.\nRecall with me the sorry saga of the Israelites failing to trust the Lord, their ongoing enslavement to fear and uncertainty and doubt. And recall too the Lord\u0026rsquo;s uncompromising response, his righteous anger burning against them, his chosen people, his beloved ones.\nWhat reason did the Israelites have to trust the Lord?\nIn the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:12-16 This is the God who miraculously delivered his people from slavery in Egypt, parting the waters of the Red Sea so they could pass safely. And led them through the desert, miraculously guiding them and remaining with them. And slaked their thirst in the desert, again, miraculously.\nAnd he fed them with manna from heaven.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day\u0026rsquo;s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 16:4 Here was the test. This is the trust test. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that the Israelites faced time and again. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that we ourselves face time and again.\nAnd how did they do, those Israelites, those chosen people, those beloved ones?\nThey forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:11 They forgot all the reasons they had to trust him! Their earlier fear of the Lord and belief in him was so feeble it had simply evaporated like the morning mist.\nBut it gets worse.\nYet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. They spoke against God, saying, ‚ÄúCan God spread a table in the wilderness? He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 78:17-20 Can you hear the sneering doubt here, the sheer contempt for their provider, the complete absence of trust? O my soul, be appalled.\nTherefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:21-22 Paul explains.\nFor I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:1-5 They drank from the Rock which was Christ no less and yet they failed the trust test. Overthrown means struck down. In judgment for their lack of trust most of them were struck down by the Lord, their hitherto protector and provider, the Faithful One. Most of them!\nThe anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:31 Why did this happen?\nBecause they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:22 This is how important it is to trust, to believe, to depend upon the Lord without wavering.\nAnd what of our own trust test?\nO my soul, even when things are very dark indeed you must trust the Lord and depend upon him relentlessly. He is faithful and true. Never doubt that!\nWho among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.\n‚Äï Isaiah 50:10 Trust is tested when our lives are at stake, when our hearts are breaking, when things are entirely beyond us and all we can do is depend upon the Lord, upon his faithfulness to all that he has promised and to all that he is, when the way ahead is unseeable. But without the unseeable there can be no faith! O my soul, will you trust him then? Will you trust him now? Will you continue to trust him?\nNow hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.\n‚Äï Romans 8:24-25 O my soul, in this waiting time of unseeing are you tempted to doubt? Are you tempted to despair? Are you tempted to run ahead of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will in your own strength? Resist! You must resist! Hold on to what is true. Hold on to the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nNo temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:13 You can endure this, O my soul. Repudiate doubt and all that drags you down, and trust him. Trust him! You must endure with steadfast faith, believing and not doubting. Trust Jesus, whose name is Faithful and True!\nThe penalty for failing the truth test is severe, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen. For standing firm, however, there are two stupendous prizes.\nFirstly,\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 Trust in him, O my soul, and he will act!\nAnd secondly,\nThe LORD‚Äôs delight is in those who fear him, those who put their hope in his unfailing love.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:11 NLT By doing this, by walking this path of trust and dependence and unwavering hope in him, waiting with patience, you can delight our Heavenly Father.

Before we come to my question though, let\u0026rsquo;s consider how the Lord regards us, his beloved ones. Let\u0026rsquo;s lose ourselves in the love letter which is Isaiah Chapter 43.\nBut now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: ‚ÄúFear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:1 Remember Jacob? He was that despicable little man, that man entirely without honour, a liar and a cheat. The man who wrestled with God, all night.

Because you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:3-4 He is my saviour. He is your saviour. The ransom is costly and there is no limit to where he will go for the rescue, because I am precious in his eyes, and honoured. Because you are precious, and he loves you.\n‚ÄúI give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.‚Äù\nO my soul, he gave one man in particular in return for you: Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, in exchange for your life. In exchange for mine.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\n‚Äï John 3:16 The ransom is costly. But fear not, O my soul, he has redeemed you!\nSo why are you here? Why do you exist? What were you created for?\nBut now thus says the LORD\nBecause you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n\u0026hellip; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:1, 4, 6-7 You were created for the glory of God. He set his love upon you, called you by name, poured out that great love at Calvary, and redeemed you. There is no higher calling than for the glory of God. It is why I am here. It is why you are here. And as we receive that great Calvary love may all see it for what it is and give God the glory due his name. Be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God!\nThe wrestling is done, O my soul. It\u0026rsquo;s time for that to end. You have been bought at a price‚∏∫an unfathomable price. But that price has been paid, and in full.\nNow may your love abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\nRejoice, O my soul, to know the magnitude of the reason why you are here.

So very weary? So weary in fact that you wonder whether you can carry on at all, even not quite knowing what that would mean?\nBut what is it that we are commanded to do?\nRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\n‚Äï Romans 12:12 Be patient in tribulation. And go on being patient. And on. And on. Being patient. In tribulation.\nBut when will it all end? Will it ever end? How can you continue to endure this, O my soul? Isn\u0026rsquo;t the prolonged nature of it all simply wearing you down?\nHave you made Job\u0026rsquo;s heart-cry your very own?\nBut I don‚Äôt have the strength to endure. I have nothing to live for.\n‚Äï Job 6:11 NLT Will it ever end? What is there to live for? Does anything even matter any more?\nO my Soul, listen to Jesus.\nBy your endurance you will gain your lives.\n‚Äï Luke 21:19 Jesus is speaking of the great tribulation, but it makes no difference. By your endurance you will gain your life, O my soul. Your endurance matters then, O how it matters! Your life depends upon it. But what is it exactly? What is this endurance by which you will gain your life, beyond simply managing to exist through the trial? What indeed? And where will this endurance come from, that you may live?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first consider the why, and through that understand the what and the how.\nFor you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:36 O my soul, do you want to receive what is promised? Do you want to receive what has been promised from the one whose name is Faithful and True? Then you have need of endurance!\nThis endurance is what will enable you to do the will of God, and to keep on doing it. So now we must ask, what is the will of God here?\nThen they said to him, ‚ÄúWhat must we do, to be doing the works of God?‚Äù Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúThis is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 6:28-29 So this is it. This is what it means to endure. Believe in Jesus, the one whom the Lord has sent! Above all else this means trust him. Trust him, absolutely and completely, and depend upon him, and on him alone.\nTrust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.\n‚Äï Proverbs 3:5-6 My own understanding is quite simply not up to the task. This is entirely beyond me. O my soul, at that point beyond which you cannot understand what or why or how, you must surrender your need to understand, and simply trust the one who does‚∏∫the one whose name is Faithful and True. Trust Jesus! And depend on him!\nBe mindful that straight does not mean easy, but it does mean that there is a way. There is a way ahead, and by taking one step after another on this straight path, trusting and not doubting, you can continue. You can continue, O my soul, so do that!\nAnd as you resolve to continue to take this path ahead, wondering whether you have the strength even for that, you must understand where strength comes from. It comes from hope. Hold on to hope. The one who promised is Faithful and True. Rejoice in that hope!\nRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\n‚Äï Romans 12:12 Strength comes from hope. It comes from trust.\nThose who trust in the LORD will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.\n‚Äï Isaiah 40:31 NLT O my Soul, I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to soaring on wings like an eagle, as that may be inconceivable for now. But know this. The word used for trust is the Hebrew q√¢v√¢h, which could be translated wait for, or hope in, or expect. Yes, more waiting. More waiting, O my soul, but waiting in hope. And rejoicing in that hope. Paul and Isaiah are perfectly aligned.\nRejoice in hope. Trust in and depend on Jesus, that he may be the one to lift you up. Oh, and be constant in prayer.\nTrust in the Lord, O my soul, and find there new strength to carry on! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-11T06:30:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/my-strength-is-almost-gone/todd-trapani-v2Jf_jpNamc-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_11477103_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/my-strength-is-almost-gone/","title":"My strength is almost gone"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat happened yesterday?\nWere you hoping for great things? Were you expecting great things? And are you tempted to say, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù? That nothing happened? (You would be so very wrong about that, by the way.)\nAnd if you think that nothing happened yesterday, now what? What will you do now? Where is hope? How can hope survive the passing of yet another day, the unrelenting accumulation of which become inexorable years? How can faith survive this, O my soul? How will this rollercoaster of expectation and disappointment not simply grind you down into the dust?\nHow indeed?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how. There are three reasons. The first reason is to understand that disappointment is a lie.\nDisappointment is a lie because it presupposes failure. But what failure would that be, exactly?\nListen to Joshua, now old and well advanced in years, passing on some wisdom at the end of his own life to those who would come after him.\nAnd now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.\n‚Äï Joshua 23:14 Not one of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promises had failed, nor has failed, nor will fail. Know that he is faithful and true, O my soul, to all that he has said, and to all that he is!\nAnd if you think that what you were hoping for yesterday didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, what you were expecting, what you were so committed in faith to receiving, then listen to the Lord himself, speaking through Isaiah.\n‚ÄúI am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,‚Äô calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:9-11 For sure, there are things not yet done, but there is none like God, declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient times. O my soul, he will do it! He will accomplish all he has purposed! Know that nothing has failed. Trust him still and praise him!\nThe second reason is because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts. Poured out for you, O my soul.\nTherefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,‚ÄØand hope does not put us to shame, because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:1-5 I will have to return another time to rejoicing in our sufferings but for now consider just that final verse, for which the Berean Standard Bible rendition is particularly helpful.\nAnd hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:5 BSB Hope does not disappoint. God himself is both the giver and the one who pours. It is his own great love. He poured out that same love at Calvary, O my soul. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God!\nThe third and final reason is to understand at least something of what did actually happen yesterday.\nWhat was I hoping for? Isaiah knows.\nOh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:1 I was hoping that the Creator God of the Universe, awesome in power and terrifying in purity but also so very good and kind, would break into this impossible situation, breathing out grace and truth and power into my own life and those around me.\nSo did he?\nFrom of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:4 Isaiah tells us that the Lord acts. Not that he will act, or even that he did act, but that he acts, in the present tense. He is working right now with great power for those who wait for him. Will you be that, O my soul? Will you continue to be that?\nAnd what is it that he is doing?\nHabbakuk knows and it cannot be told. The Lord himself declares it.\n‚ÄúLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.‚Äù\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 Wonder and be astounded, O my soul, at what the Lord is already doing in your life, and renounce disappointment! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-04T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/istrfry-marcus-NX0WjgdQl58-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1794935_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/","title":"That was yesterday"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhen do you expect change will come?\nAfter so many years spent hoping and trusting, holding on to your promise from the Lord and yet still waiting, are you tempted to give up?\nOr do you still somehow expect that the Lord will act with great power to fulfil that promise? And when exactly do you expect that?\nThere is only one answer which honours the Lord and that is today. You must continue to expect it and you must expect it today! It is imperative that you do so. Your very faith depends upon it. Your life and health and strength depend upon it. How else could you live a life that honours him, other than in complete trust and dependence upon him, and other than in expectation of the imminent outworking of his great power in your life?\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23 He who promised is indeed faithful. His very name is Faithful and True (Rev 19:11).\nBut why is it quite so important to hold fast to this hope, this expectation of imminent fulfilment, without wavering?\nWe are in the midst of a spiritual battle and the fighting is fierce. To expect anything other than imminent fulfilment would open the door to doubt ‚∏∫that doubt which is so ready to creep in and steal away hope and joy and expectation. That doubt which would cause all to unravel and expose the tattered remains of a faith which once was. That doubt which must be resisted with all strength. Be steadfast, O my soul! Cry out to the Faithful One, Lord I believe! Help my unbelief!\nSo Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. And Elijah came near to all the people and said, ‚ÄúHow long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.‚Äù And the people did not answer him a word.\nAnd they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, ‚ÄúO Baal, answer us!‚Äù But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‚ÄúCry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:20-21, 26-27 O my soul, are you tempted to such thoughts while you wait on the living God, the God of your life? Repudiate them!\nAnd at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, ‚ÄúO LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.‚Äù Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, ‚ÄúThe LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:36-39 The Lord, he is God! Praise him, O my soul!\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer to our most earnest praying, the outworking of his mighty strength in our lives to fulfil all that he has promised, is that all may know that the Lord, he is God! And his grace and kindness is that you, O my soul, may know it. Expect it today!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nOur experience of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power being outworked in our lives is limited only by our faith to believe it, our faith to receive it. This is why it is quite so important that we do not hold back in expectation.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30 O my soul, do you believe that he is able to do this? According to your faith be it done to you. Do not hold back in expectation!\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s yet more.\n‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 3:16-18 What do you dare to believe, O my soul, of the only Son of God. Do not hold back in expectation!\nThis is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:24 This is the day, O my soul!

Are you grieving for things that once were and are no longer? So was the psalmist.\nThese things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:4 Here is a man who used to live a life of affirmation and exaltation. But things changed and he became a pariah, even in his own church.\nAs with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:10 Or perhaps, O my soul, does the Lord seem to have withdrawn? Are you no longer enjoying that intimacy, the sweetness of his felt presence in your life? Nor was the psalmist. But the desire for that had not left him.\nMy soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:2-3 The multitude keeping festival, those privileged and self-satisfied ones, had closed ranks, and he was no longer among them. And it seemed to him that God himself had passed him by, forgotten him, rejected him. He was oppressed, scorned, and despised.\nIs there any hope? Is anything to be done?\nWhy are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation‚ÄØand my God.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:5-6, also v11 and Psalm 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? This is not a question in search of an answer. This is a rebuke. It is a rebuke delivered to one who has taken their eyes off the Lord, and has become overwhelmed by their own difficulties and disappointments, defeated by them and yet dwelling in them.\nHope in God, O my soul! Hope in the only one in whom you really can!\nMy soul does indeed thirst for God. But where is hope?\nBy day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:8 His love is steadfast. All his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness (Psalm 25:10). And he is the God of my life‚∏∫the God of my whole life.\nThe Lord is not ignorant of nor indifferent to what is happening in my life. He has plans and purposes for me that are beyond my understanding. He is ambitious for me in ways that would blow my mind if I only knew. He is transforming me into the likeness of Christ, and he knows how to do it, O how he knows! He is the God of my life.\nWhat must I do then? I must trust. I must trust the God of my life, who knows his work.\nAnd what is this song that is with me through the night, when tears are my only food? The psalmist knew.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:14 Isaiah knew.\n‚ÄúBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 12:2 But these are borrowed words. They are Moses\u0026rsquo; words. This is Moses\u0026rsquo; song.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father\u0026rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.\n‚Äï Exodus 15:2 And what is the context of Moses\u0026rsquo; song?\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\nThus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.\n‚Äï Exodus 14:21, 30-31 This song must be the refrain of your life: the habit of remembering who the Lord is and what he has done. It is the habit of remembering as you do the dishes, as you drive to work, as you grapple with the challenges of life. It is the habit of remembering the God of your life and the great power that he uses to rescue those he loves. Dwell in that, my soul.\nAnd do not underestimate the discipline and determination required to sing this song, to make it the habit of your life, but this you must do, single-mindedly, doggedly, courageously. It is a matter of life and death. Take your eyes off yourself, look to the Lord and hope in him. There is no other.\nHope in the Lord, O my soul, for there is no other! üôè\n","date":"2024-05-21T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/jeremy-bishop-DLICfSD33as-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2634415_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/","title":"Hope in God"}]
