[{"content":"O my soul,\nIs your heart overflowing?\nNo?\nTherefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.\n‚Äï Hebrews 2:1 Pay much closer attention then. But to what? To what must we pay closer attention? How about this love song?\nTo the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah; a love song.\n‚Äï Psalm 45 heading Here in fact is the very best of love songs. O my soul, are you ready to sing?\nMy heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.\n‚Äï Psalm 45:1 Are you ready to address the king? Is your tongue ready like the pen of a scribe? So who is this king? And what will you write? Let\u0026rsquo;s consider him.\nYou are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendour and majesty!\n‚Äï Psalm 45:2-3 This king is most handsome and mighty in splendour and majesty. But how is any of this relevant? Isn\u0026rsquo;t this merely some dusty old psalm about David or one of those other so very few noble kings of Israel. By no means! Let us behold here something truly wondrous.\nIn your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds! Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king\u0026rsquo;s enemies; the peoples fall under you.\n‚Äï Psalm 45:4-5 The king\u0026rsquo;s cause is truth and meekness and righteousness. Meekness is our first real clue as to his identity.\nYour throne, O God, is forever and ever. The sceptre of your kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.\n‚Äï Psalm 45:6-8a And here is the reveal‚∏∫the anointing and the robes and the fragrance. For the anointing is with the oil of gladness and the fragrance is of myrrh and aloes. It is the fragrance of death.\nAfter [Jesus died] Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.\n‚Äï John 19:38-42 And what of cassia? Moses was instructed in that.\nThe LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúTake the finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of aromatic cane, and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 30:22-25 It is a holy anointing oil. It is an oil of holiness and of death and yet also an oil of gladness.\nBut where is the love song we were promised? Right here.\nHear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father\u0026rsquo;s house, and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. The people of Tyre will seek your favour with gifts, the richest of the people.‚Å†\n‚Äï Psalm 45:10-12 So if the king is Jesus who is this daughter whose beauty he desires? She is the one who has made him her Lord. She is the one who has left her past behind and who is living for him. She is his church.\nAnd look how he sees her.\nAll glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold. In many-coloured robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her. With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.\n‚Äï Psalm 45:13-15 She is his glorious church, his beloved bride. And with joy and gladness she enters his presence, the palace of the king.\nThis is the love song between Jesus and his church. It is a song founded on myrrh and aloes. It is a song founded on her leaving and cleaving. It is our song.\nAnd what happens as we sing this song?\nI will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.\n‚Äï Psalm 45:17 O my soul, sing this love song to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, that his name be remembered in all generations! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2025-06-20T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/a-love-song/darius-F8E2tks5N04-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3795883_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/a-love-song/","title":"A love song"},{"content":"O my soul,\nAre you ready to give up? To throw in the towel? Are you utterly spent? Empty and exhausted? Does it seem to you that you have been abandoned by God?\nKnow that you are not alone.\nMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:1-2 Here is the psalmist, crying out in bewilderment to God, my God: Why have you forsaken me? Unable to sleep. Exhausted. Empty. Groaning in misery.\nMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\n‚Äï Psalm 22:1a But there is no answer.\nIs what lies ahead simply too hard? Is this the end? Is the enemy too strong?\nMany bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me; they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.\nI am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast; my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:12-15 I am truly poured out. Has God himself laid me in the dust of death? I have nothing left. I am completely spent. There is no more.\nO my soul, but there is!\nFor there are two voices in the psalm. It is a conversation, a to and fro. We have heard from despair. But there is also hope. Listen now to hope.\nYet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. In you our fathers trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them. To you they cried and were rescued; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:3-5 Here is hope, and here are reasons for hope. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider four reasons.\nFirstly and most obviously, the Lord is trustworthy. Those who went before us cried out to God, they trusted him, and he delivered them. He delivered them. They were not put to shame.\n‚ÄúFor I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.‚Äù\n‚Äï Malachi 3:6 Hope in the Lord does not disappoint. It never has. So hope in him.\nThere is a second and slightly less obvious reason for hope, which is that the Lord is holy, enthroned on the praises of his people. Why is this a reason?\nAll around us we see reason to despair, to lose hope, to give up. People are duplicitous and there are ulterior motives. Shady and shadowy conversations abound. Self-interest is everywhere.\nSurely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 7:20 But the Lord is not like that. He is set apart from all that contaminates and all that corrupts. He is holy.\nO my soul, rejoice that the Lord is holy.\nAnd the third reason?\nYet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother\u0026rsquo;s breasts. On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother\u0026rsquo;s womb you have been my God.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:9-10 O my soul, not only has the Lord been faithful to those who went before, he has been faithful to you, your whole life.\nWhich leads us to the fourth and by far the most important reason for hope. Because of course the psalm is prophetic.\nFor dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet‚∏∫I can count all my bones‚∏∫they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:16-18 I rather doubt that David even knew why he was writing this. But we know.\nAnd they brought [Jesus] to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).\nAnd they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.\n‚Äï Mark 15:22,24 O my soul, if you think you have been abandoned by God, you need to think again about who actually was abandoned on your behalf, and why.\nAnd when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, ‚ÄúEloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?‚Äù which means, ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù\nAnd Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.\n‚Äï Mark 15:33,34,37,38 So what does this mean? The psalmist tells us.\nAll the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you. For kingship belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.\nPosterity shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation; they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn, that he has done it.\n‚Äï Psalm 22:27,28,30,31 He has done it! The curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. Nothing now separates us from our Heavenly Father. Thank and praise the Lord that he has done it.\nWho shall bring any charge against God\u0026rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died‚∏∫more than that, who was raised‚∏∫who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?\n‚Äï Romans 8:33-35 O my soul, rejoice that nothing can separate you from the love of Christ, no matter how hard the journey seems! üôè\n","date":"2025-06-13T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/why-have-you-forsaken-me/massimiliano-sarno-0Zg-9QGS0gg-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1881526_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/why-have-you-forsaken-me/","title":"Why have you forsaken me?"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDid Solomon in fact discover anything of value on his tragic quest, on his journey of self-destruction?\nHe most certainly did. He was after all the wisest man who ever lived.\nI have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man\u0026rsquo;s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 3:10-11 Let\u0026rsquo;s consider this carefully, for there is enormous blessing in Solomon\u0026rsquo;s insight here, such that we should be grateful to him for the sacrifice he made of himself to uncover it.\nHe has made everything beautiful in its time.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 3:11a Everything!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s focus in then on just one of these beautiful things. O my soul, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on your own failure and shame and loss and searing pain, and your despising and rejection. Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on these, for he has made everything beautiful in its time, even this.\nBut how could this possibly be true? How could something so wrong, so shameful, and so humiliating, be made beautiful?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how.\nFirstly, we may have to receive this in the prophetic past tense. He has made everything beautiful in its time. It is a certainty, but it may not yet have been fulfilled. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s timing is such a mystery but his faithfulness is not. His name is Faithful and True.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s dig in.\nThe LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:18 How can heartbreak and loss be made beautiful? Because they are a gateway. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted. This is both consolation and exceeding joy.\nYou must know, however, that you have a choice here. In your pain and loss and suffering and heartbreak, you can harden your heart and set your face and resent your situation and turn away from the Lord, or you can soften your heart and run to the Lord and cast yourself upon him and pour out your sorrow there, and surrender to his goodness and sovereignty.\nWhich will you do?\nFor in heartbreak and loss you have a unique advantage. The things of this world have lost their grip on you. If all you have is the Lord, it is so much more straightforward to put him at the centre of your life, to love him and live for him alone.\nDelight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:4 This of course is nothing less than an astonishing and lavish promise from the Lord that he will give himself to the one who delights in him alone.\nThe things of this world are such a distraction, such a barrier to wholehearted love and devotion to the Lord. We saw that with Solomon. The Apostle Paul expands upon this.\nBut whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith‚∏∫that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.\n‚Äï Philippians 3:7-11 Do not shy away from sharing in Christ\u0026rsquo;s sufferings. Marvel at the intimacy with the Saviour which is to be found there. What a privilege and what a joy!\nAnd suffering also can be a gateway to holiness.\nSince therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 4:1-2 Do not overlook your choice which will determine whether the suffering becomes a process of sanctification or of hardening. O my soul, soften your heart and surrender to the work of the Saviour upon you. It is more painful by far but the rewards are great.\nAlso do not overlook in the pain and the shame and the humiliation the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power to use precisely these to excise all pride from your life and replace it with humble gratitude. Hallelujah! What a Saviour!\nBut beware. As you start upon this path and become more aware of the enormous blessing you are receiving and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s mighty work of transformation in your life, be most careful to avoid this mistaken belief: that it is the Lord who caused your failure and shame and pain, and for this reason. For might it not be natural to suppose that he would consider the sacrifice to be worth it? But this is not how he works.\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 The Lord works these painful and shameful things together for good, but he did not cause them.\nThere is mystery here, and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s ways are difficult to fathom indeed, but in the heartbreak and in the pain have you noticed that your longing for the Lord is beginning to be satisfied?\nI have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man\u0026rsquo;s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 3:10-11 O my soul, know that the Lord is making beauty from the ashes of your life, and he is not done yet! üôè\n","date":"2025-06-06T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/everything-beautiful-in-its-time/dietmar-becker-8Zt0xOOK4nI-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1195677_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/everything-beautiful-in-its-time/","title":"Everything beautiful in its time"},{"content":"O my soul,\nCan you solve the enigma of Solomon?\nAnd what is that, I hear you ask? Simply this. How did a man whose wisdom surpassed that of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt, who was wiser than all other men, how did this man so completely and comprehensively lose his way?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a sobering question for anyone who perhaps sees themselves as growing in wisdom or desiring to do so, but it is a vital question nonetheless.\nSolomon famously asked for this wisdom.\nAt Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, ‚ÄúAsk what I shall give you.‚Äù And Solomon said, ‚ÄúYou have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?‚Äù\nIt pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. And God said to him, ‚ÄúBecause you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 3:5-12 And so he did.\nBut that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all. The Lord blessed him materially and super-abundantly, although perhaps this part wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite the blessing that some might have thought it to be.\n‚ÄúI give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honour, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 3:13-14 Note well the vital condition that was attached to this blessing, because this is our first insight into the enigma.\nActually there was a clue that all was not well even at the beginning of his reign.\nSolomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 3:3 These high places were the downfall of other right and true kings. And as we have considered previously they were the worldliness of the day.\nSo even at the outset and before receiving the material blessing, Solomon was compromised.\nBut his wisdom continued to grow.\nAnd God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all other men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3000 proverbs, and his songs were 1005. He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish. And people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 4:29-34 So how did it all go so horribly wrong? For tragically it did.\nFor when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 11:4-8 We are told at the head of this very paragraph what had happened here.\nNow King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, ‚ÄúYou shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.‚Äù Solomon clung to these in love. He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 11:1-3 What a euphemism! Solomon loved many foreign women. He lusted after them, he acquired them, and he satiated his lust with them, endlessly. And his wives turned away his heart after their gods. 700 wives and 300 concubines. What a depraved and licentious wretch he was! And what a betrayal not only of God\u0026rsquo;s commandment but also his creational ordinance in the singular.\nTherefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\n‚Äï Genesis 2:24 But this is surely the culmination rather than the turning point. We already saw that he started out sacrificing and making offerings at the high places to the pagan gods. How did this so deteriorate? How did the rot set in? And what led him along the path that ended at this point of total depravity?\nIt was surely his pride that made him think he could go exploring boundaries, and in sheer foolishness he thought it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect him. Pride and foolishness.\nThe words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.\nVanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity. What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun? A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 1:1-4 Vanity means vapour. Ephemeral and so meaningless.\nAnd so he embarked on a mission to find meaning in what he perceived as the pointlessness of existence. But where was God in all this? He hadn\u0026rsquo;t even paused to consider.\nCompletely dissatisfied with his gift of wisdom from the Lord which he now despised, he made a terrible mistake.\nI said in my heart, ‚ÄúCome now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.‚Äù\nI searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine‚∏∫my heart still guiding me with wisdom‚∏∫and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 2:1a, 3 My heart still guiding me with wisdom?! No it was not!\nI also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man. So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.\n‚Äï Ecclesiastes 2:8-10 In his prideful and hedonistic pursuit he thought he had retained his wisdom. He had not. He had corrupted and debased himself.\nFor the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them.\n‚Äï Proverbs 1:32 He was not simple but he was complacent. And indeed it did destroy him. How ironic to be the illustration for his own proverb.\nEvery prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly.\n‚Äï Proverbs 13:16 Had he not done precisely that?\nThe discerning sets his face toward wisdom, but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.\n‚Äï Proverbs 17:24 The ends of the earth are where we find pride. Didn\u0026rsquo;t he think he was really something? And the tragedy of it all is that he could have been.\nThrough the book of Ecclesiastes we see him doubling down on this, persisting in this folly which would destroy him.\nLike a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.\n‚Äï Proverbs 26:11-12 What had he missed along the way?\nHe has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\n‚Äï Micah 6:8 It was pride that had caused him to lose his way.\nNow, you certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have the wisdom of Solomon, but do you have his pride?\nO my soul, be most vigilant against pride infiltrating into your own life, and be sure to walk humbly with your God! üôè\n","date":"2025-05-30T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-enigma-of-solomon/danny-g-ka4wDQPFm2c-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2609992_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-enigma-of-solomon/","title":"The enigma of Solomon"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow will you be OK?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how.\nI will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:1 Do not underestimate the power of praise for lifting you up, out of discouragement, out of doubt, out of despair, out of the place of being despised and rejected, and into light and truth and grace and personal holiness.\nRecall that it was the Apostle Peter who brought us to Psalm 34, writing to those in the midst of suffering.\nFinally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For\n‚ÄúWhoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Peter 3:8-10 In the face of all that is broken and dysfunctional you must bless. You must be a blessing so that you may receive a blessing. So praise the Lord!\nAnd to this end we must acknowledge that the exhortations and the prohibitions are not here without reason. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling. And keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.\nSo we must address the severe temptation which is ever present for those who are hurting. For those who have been shamefully treated. For those who have been despised and rejected. And that is the temptation to strike back with the tongue.\nDeath and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.\n‚Äï Proverbs 18:21 For those who are hurting this temptation may be severe indeed‚∏∫to strike back with a fatal blow, with words spoken with intent to bring down and to destroy. Isn\u0026rsquo;t bringing down the prideful with carefully chosen words so inviting? Don\u0026rsquo;t they deserve it? Perhaps so, but O my soul, you must not do it!\nThe psalmist reflected on the ways of the arrogant and the wicked.\nThey scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.\n‚Äï Psalm 73:8-9 O my soul, will your tongue strut through the earth? May it not be so!\nCome, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:11-16 Do you see how important it is to bridle the tongue? It is foremost among these exhortations for anyone desiring a life filled with goodness, even ahead of actually doing good and seeking peace.\nThe one who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever utters slander is a fool.\n‚Äï Proverbs 10:18 Concealed hatred poisons and corrupts the one who holds it. It\u0026rsquo;s not that it must be vented, but rather expurgated.\nAnd if you expect or even desire to dwell in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s presence, think on this.\nO LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbour, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honours those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent.

That the God of all power and knowledge of every last detail about you and your situation, and being deeply invested in both, would have acted? And has he still not? Even after all this time?\nWe considered this quite recently.\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 In the silence and in the inaction you must continue to trust in him. You must! And even as you wait on him, believing and not doubting, know that he is doing a mighty work of transformation in you, building love and holiness and faith‚∏∫so much faith!\nAnd yet, the longing does not go away, does it?‚∏∫longing for deliverance, for mercy, and for judgment on that which dishonours the Lord. Because there is plenty that dishonours his Holy Name, and it is close at hand.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s now discover another reason for the waiting, for the delay, for the apparent inaction. And may our discovery be faith-building, as we marvel once again at the goodness and mercy of God.\nFor if you long for God to act with mighty power to deal with all that you face and all that is faced by this broken world, do be careful what you wish for!\nThe LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, ‚ÄúI will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 6:5-7 Do you think that the Lord doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel similarly about today\u0026rsquo;s world and today\u0026rsquo;s evil?\nRecall what he had done.\nThen God said, ‚ÄúLet us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.‚Äù\nSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\n‚Äï Genesis 1:26-27 Humankind had been created in God\u0026rsquo;s own image with such capacity for love, for goodness, for kindness, and for holiness. But in his infinite wisdom and out of love God had not created automata, programmed simply to follow the Maker\u0026rsquo;s desired path. For love is defined by the ability to choose to love, goodness and kindness by the ability to choose them, and holiness too. And with that ability to choose comes the ability to choose not.\nWhat a risk God had taken in creating such beings. And now he regretted that he had made humankind on the earth and it grieved him to his heart. Tremble at his intent to deal with the wickedness.\nSo the LORD said, ‚ÄúI will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 6:7 And yet at the same time be grateful that there was one who stayed his hand, that there was a but.\nBut Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD.\nThese are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.\n‚Äï Genesis 6:8-9 One righteous man was the reason that God did not blot out humankind from the face of the earth. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it almost unfathomable that a single human life lived with holiness and in honour of the Lord could have had such a profound impact upon the whole human race? O my soul, do not underestimate the value of living a God-honouring life of personal holiness.\nBut why are we even here considering Noah in the context of our opening question? Simply because of what the Apostle Peter wrote, and what he wrote is profound. He wrote first and foremost about facing trials and suffering and evil in the world, and he was clearly familiar with waiting and hoping and longing for deliverance.\nFinally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 3:8-9 He continues by quoting Psalm 34.\nFor\n‚ÄúWhoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Peter 3:10-12 O my soul, in your place of hoping and longing and waiting, immerse yourself in Psalm 34, and know that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s ears are open to your prayer.\nI will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:1 I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:4 Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:5 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:18 The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.\n‚Äï Psalm 34:22 But we must move on to Peter\u0026rsquo;s point about Noah.\nFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,‚ÄØin which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God\u0026rsquo;s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 3:18-20 Do you see? God\u0026rsquo;s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared. It is not inaction at all that we see from the Lord, but rather patience. And why is he patient?\nThe Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.\n‚Äï 2 Peter 3:9 And there we have it. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s strong desire is that none should perish but that all should reach repentance. And so he holds back, as he himself is waiting, is longing, is hoping.\nO my soul, be patient yourself, trust the Lord, and keep waiting and longing and hoping! üôè\n","date":"2025-05-16T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/a-wondrous-reason/federico-burgalassi-K7M-TG05LTo-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2469143_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/a-wondrous-reason/","title":"A wondrous reason"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you doubt the adequacy of God?\nAdequacy for what, you may ask? Well, everything.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the Apostle Paul\u0026rsquo;s heart-cry to the Lord.\nThree times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 12:8-10 The context here is Paul\u0026rsquo;s ongoing struggle with the thorn in his flesh, a very real and almost overwhelming challenge and discouragement he had to endure. I have written before about the nature of the thorn, so let\u0026rsquo;s skip over that for now.\nWhat remains is this statement of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s. ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù\nO my soul, his grace is sufficient for you no matter what you are facing. No matter what lies ahead or what has gone before. Do you doubt it? You must not!\nDo you even understand ‚Äúfor when I am weak, then I am strong‚Äù. This is so important. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider why.\nWeak here is the Greek asthene≈ç, which mostly means sick or infirm and can mean feeble or powerless. But sickness is debilitating, so what exactly is this strength? It is actually very simple, albeit most uncomfortable. Because when I am powerless, all I can do is trust the Lord, that he will protect and defend and do that which is beyond me.\nIt is so difficult to do this from a position of health and strength because that is the place of self-sufficiency. The one who is self-sufficient does not look to the Lord but to their own strength and ability, ironically so puny in comparison.\nThere are many different reasons for powerlessness and some have nothing to do with sickness or infirmity. One of these is integral to those power structures found in every human institution, every organisation, every social structure. In every such place there are usually a handful of people who hold power to the extent that others are almost entirely powerless. No depth of insight or wisdom or ability can counteract this, as such power is seductive and captivating and utterly intoxicating to the ones who wield it, and they simply will not give it up. And so oligarchy is the default state pretty much everywhere.\nJob wrestled with this.\nWhy do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?\n‚Äï Job 21:7 But he didn\u0026rsquo;t receive an answer.\nSo when these powermongers lose their way and stray from the path of what is right and true, what is to be done?\nOf course the answer for you and me is simply nothing. But with the Lord it is not so. By no means! And so we must trust him‚∏∫that he knows and he cares and he is powerful to act.\nAnd lest you think that you yourself are untainted by this arrogance and self-deception, beware, for each one of us is equally vulnerable to temptation in this regard.\nTake care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today, lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them, and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied, then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock, who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end. Beware lest you say in your heart, ‚ÄòMy power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth.‚Äô\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 8:11-17 Have the boundary lines fallen for you in pleasant places? Then thank and praise the Lord and acknowledge the wonders of his grace! Do not try to claim these as your own achievements but rather pray along with David.\nTherefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: ‚ÄúBlessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.\n‚Äï 1 Chronicles 29:10 But back to powerlessness. Jesus himself experienced it as he emptied himself of all but love on his journey towards the cross.\nBut you, O LORD, do not be far off! O you my help, come quickly to my aid! Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!\n‚Äï Psalm 22:19-20 How humiliating for the Lord of all Creation, the Word of Life himself, to be given over to the power of the dog.\nBut it did not and will not remain so. Praise the Lord!\nBut he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 14:61-62 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s name is Power, and indeed all power belongs to him. So listen to Paul again rejoicing in his own weakness.\nBut we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus\u0026rsquo; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 4:7-12 How interesting. Somehow the forces of evil arrayed against him were being kept in check. Of course they were, because the surpassing power belongs to God and not us. And what is that power?\nFor this reason, \u0026hellip;, I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, \u0026hellip;, that you may know \u0026hellip; what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:15,16,18,19-21 That same power that raised Christ from the dead is at work around us and toward us and for us and in us. O my soul, that power is probably enough don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\nWhy do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, ‚ÄúMy way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God?‚Äù Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.\n‚Äï Isaiah 40:27-29 The Lord is more than enough for whatever the situation. Praise him!\nO my soul, rest in the adequacy of God and be grateful for your own weakness, so that the power of Christ may rest upon you! üôè\n","date":"2025-05-09T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-adequacy-of-god/dustin-belt-lg4fM9Y2pGg-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3838315_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-adequacy-of-god/","title":"The adequacy of God"},{"content":"O my soul,\nIs it simply too hard to forgive your accusers for their whispered lies against you? For the way they have crushed you from the shadows? For the way they have acted in blatant disregard for Jesus\u0026rsquo; teaching?\nWhat is that teaching?\n‚ÄúIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 18:15 Of course they did not do that. Whatever offence they allege you have committed against them, rather than seek reconciliation as Jesus commanded, instead they have held on to their own hurt, nurturing it and tending to it until it established itself as bitterness and resentment, until it became a grudge, fueling their whispering against you in the shadows.\nSo what now? How will you respond? Interestingly Jesus moves straight on to the parable of the unmerciful servant.\nThen Peter came up and said to him, ‚ÄúLord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.\n‚ÄúTherefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 18:21-23 The parable is familiar, and links our own forgiveness of others with our Heavenly Father\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness of us. It is the same in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer.\nForgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\nFor if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:12, 14-15 The link between our own forgiveness of others and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness of our own trespasses is stark.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t this forgiveness too hard? Too painful? Are you expected simply to absorb that pain and the hurt they have caused you, as if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter?\nOf course it matters! It matters terribly! It is grievous. So what to do?\nYou must recognise that you are being tempted. You are being tempted by the Father of Lies, to hold on to your own hurt, nurturing it and tending to it just as your accusers must have done with theirs.\nAgain I find the juxtaposition of passages in the Bible to be so revealing. For not only do we have here in Matthew Chapter 18 the teaching on reconciliation followed immediately by the parable of the unmerciful servant, but what do we find Jesus teaching just before this?\n‚ÄúWoe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 18:7 Temptation here means stumbling block. It is necessary that stumbling blocks come. Necessary? How can this be necessary? Let\u0026rsquo;s apply this to your own temptation to withhold forgiveness for your accusers.\nThen Peter came up and said to him, ‚ÄúLord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 18:21-22 Luke records Jesus as saying the same thing, but here the emphasis on the ongoing need to forgive is even stronger.\n‚ÄúPay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‚ÄòI repent,‚Äô you must forgive him.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 17:3-4 Seven times in a day! And the next day likely the same. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this test the limits of forgiveness? But isn\u0026rsquo;t that exactly the point? Those limits must be exposed and then removed. There can be no limit here.\nPut on then, as God\u0026rsquo;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:12-13 As the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\nWhen did you last need forgiveness from the Lord? Was it not today? And has today\u0026rsquo;s count reached seven, or are you in truth far beyond that? And the day before? And tomorrow? O my soul, you do know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about!\nAs the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\nIndeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.\n‚Äï Hebrews 9:22 And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. And Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Äï Luke 23:33-34 There is a cost to forgiveness and it is enormous. Jesus paid the price, and even as he was paying that price, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.‚Äù\nAnd so too there is a cost for you to forgive and it is more than pain. Something has to die. What is that something? It is that spirit which demands to justify your own position. It is that spirit which desires to fight back. It is that spirit which would take all of your own pain and hurt and return it in kind. It is pride.\nRepudiate that spirit of pride.\nAs the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.‚Äù\nPut to death the pride that stands in the way of forgiveness. It is painful for sure. But know that the biggest pain sensor in the human body is called the ego. Put it to death. Make it your sacrifice of forgiveness to the Lord.\nAnd notice what Paul commanded must be put on.\nPut on then \u0026hellip; humility, \u0026hellip; , forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:12-13 So why are these stumbling blocks so necessary? These temptations to withhold forgiveness? Because how can we do a thing without first learning how to do it? And how can we learn without doing it again, and again. And over again. Seven times in a day. More than seven. Seventy seven times. Seventy times seven.\nDo not overlook that seven symbolises perfection. Your forgiveness must be perfect. So keep practising! It is necessary that you do.\nTwo last points.\nPaul writes,\nAnyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 2:10-11 Satan is constantly at work drip-feeding his poison into the ears of believers. Forgiveness is such a powerful weapon to neutralise this. May we not be ignorant of his designs.\nAnd finally and most importantly,\nOn the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ‚ÄúPeace be with you.‚Äù When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, ‚ÄúPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.‚Äù And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, ‚ÄúReceive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 20:19-23 Tremble at the responsibility you have been given. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.\nO my soul, forgiveness is Kingdom work.

Of course you do not know because the accusations have not been brought into the light.\nAnd this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.\n‚Äï John 3:19-20 These accusations are indeed thoroughly wicked.\nWicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues. They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.

Clothe yourself in your prayer and wrap it tightly around you. Become that prayer. I am prayer.\nHelp me, O LORD my God! Save me according to your steadfast love!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:26 And then what? Know that David was beset by wicked and deceitful mouths speaking against him with lying tongues. So what was his response? What was his heart-cry? What what his prayer for his accuser? Listen and be appalled.\nMay his days be few; may another take his office! May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:8-9 His prayer was for divine judgment of death upon his accuser. And not only that but financial disaster upon the remnant of his family.\nMay his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit! May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:10-11 And not only that but also for them childlessness and destruction.\nMay his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:13 This diatribe of a prayer continues for fifteen verses. Fifteen verses! What an outpouring of anger and bewilderment and pain and grief and dismay.\nThere are several such imprecatory psalms in the Bible and some harsher even than this. What are we to make of them? And what are we to take from this? Is this to be a model for our own praying in such times?\nBy no means!\nO my soul, you must understand how to take these prayers of David, how to use them, how to learn from them.

He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones! May it be like a garment that he wraps around him, like a belt that he puts on every day! May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:17-20 David is hurting. The whispered accusations have crushed him. He has been destroyed by wicked and deceitful mouths speaking against him with lying tongues, and it really hurts.\nO my soul, it hurts, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? And it is so unjust. It is absolutely and thoroughly wicked, and it contradicts all that Jesus taught.\nDavid\u0026rsquo;s fifteen verses of diatribe show us how much he is hurting as he lashes out in prayer. With some relief we can finally observe him get it all out and move on to something more reasonable, to a curse more proportionate.\nMay my accusers be clothed with dishonour; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!\n‚Äï Psalm 109:29 Now that he got all that out of his system is this where we should stand together with David? Again no.\nWhat did Jesus say?\n‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.‚Äô But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 5:43-45 O my soul, having been the victim of deceitful mouths and lying tongues, of accusations whispered from the shadows from those who do not come into the light, your response must be love and prayer, and to be exceedingly clear, prayer for repentance and rescue and transformation and not for harm. For what is the best possible outcome?\nSo that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.\n‚Äï Matthew 5:45a If one day you can stand alongside your accusers as sons of your Father, then you will be brothers with them‚∏∫brothers and sisters in Christ.\nTo be sure, you cannot love your faceless accusers without knowing who they are. But you can forgive them. You can choose not to resent them. You can pray for them. And you can desire reconciliation.\nO my soul, observe the harm and the hurt done to David by his accusers, know that you are not alone in your own hurt, and now put that aside and respond with gentleness and forgiveness! üò≠üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2025-04-25T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/curse-the-accuser/miguel-alcantara-19IDRDmMLgU-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_6692801_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/curse-the-accuser/","title":"Curse the accuser?"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhen is a mystery not a mystery? Why, when it has been revealed of course!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider just what has been revealed and why.\nThe secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 29:29 Specifically on this Good Friday I want to consider the revelation of the mystery of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will, according to his purpose, from my desert island chapter of the Bible. And of course it is all and entirely about Jesus.\nIn him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:7-10 Let\u0026rsquo;s unpack this slowly and carefully, for the words are so familiar we are at risk of progressing past them without really noticing what they\u0026rsquo;re even saying, when in fact we should again be completely overwhelmed by the goodness and kindness and sovereignty and justice of the Father, and by the riches of his grace.\nIn Jesus we have redemption. Thayer defines redemption as a releasing effected by payment of a ransom. So we must remind ourselves from what we have been released.\nAnd you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience‚∏∫among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.‚Å†\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:1-3 I was dead in my trespasses and sins, and this was the norm as I merely followed the course of this world along with several billion others. How ironic that those who live in the passions of their flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind thinking they are free to do so are in fact slaves to sin, in bondage, children of wrath by their very nature, like the whole of mankind. We cannot understand the magnitude of this redemption‚∏∫this release‚∏∫without first understanding the sheer wretchedness and utter hopelessness of the previous state.\nBut it was more wretched and more hopeless even than that. I was obliviously following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Satan has such a hold on those sometimes seen merely as worldly, and so many remain in ignorance of this. It is entirely a spiritual battle, and without Christ the battle is hopeless.\nBut we are not without Christ! And realising this and the magnitude of the rescue, how can humble gratitude not come flooding into our hearts, and love for our wonderful Saviour? And worship and adoration of our Heavenly Father whose purpose this is?\nAnd what was the ransom that was paid to release us from that previous state? It was the blood of the Lamb, the very Son of God.\nAnd they brought [Jesus] to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).\nAnd they crucified him.\nAnd when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, ‚ÄúEloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?‚Äù which means, ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 15:22,24a,33-34 Behold the only Son of God crying out in anguish, forsaken by the Father who turned his face away from his only and most beloved Son. And you and I both know the reason why, the answer to Jesus\u0026rsquo; most desperate question. We know it only because in all wisdom and insight our Heavenly Father has made known to us the mystery of his will. This is no secret‚∏∫it has been revealed to us according the riches of his grace. Jesus was forsaken on that cross so that we may not be. The debt that he paid was entirely ours. Our redemption is through the blood of the Lamb, poured out at Calvary for the forgiveness of sins, such a costly sacrifice.\nOur Heavenly Father turned his face away from his beloved Son precisely so that he could turn it towards us, previously miserable, hopeless and helpless sinners.\nAnd this was all according to God\u0026rsquo;s purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time. So it\u0026rsquo;s worth asking when he did this. When exactly did he set forth this plan? Behold! It was right at the beginning! Only moments after sin first came into the world.\nThe LORD God said to the serpent, ‚ÄúBecause you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 3:14-15 Our rescue was planned so far ahead of time.\nIn him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:11-12 And what of the fullness of time? Yet more revelation, this time through John the Apostle.\nThen I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer.\n‚Äï Revelation 20:1-3a But finally, we must remember why it is that these things are revealed.\nThe secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 29:29 The Apostle Paul expands upon this.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:3-4 Our Heavenly Father chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him.\nSo this we must do, out of gratitude and adoration for our wonderful Saviour, as an act of worship, and in the power and grace of our risen Lord Jesus.\nBut still the real mystery remains. Why would he do this? Why would the Creator God of the Universe set his love upon what is unlovely, those dead in trespasses and sins, at such great cost? We cannot fathom this. We can only thank and praise and worship and adore the one who made it so.\nO my soul, this mystery is revealed and yet remains. Worship and adore its divine author! üôè\n","date":"2025-04-18T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-things-that-are-revealed/vladimir-soares-3fer5_PzDkM-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1457282_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-things-that-are-revealed/","title":"The things that are revealed"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhy are there secrets?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mean the kind of secrets those lacking in credibility or legitimacy in leadership use to wield power over others. No, albeit grievous, that is straightforward to understand, just as Jesus said.\n‚ÄúAnd this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 3:19-21 Do not worry about those.\nFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 5:10 No, I mean these:\nThe secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 29:29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God. Why are there such things that are secret? And why is it that so many of the most important things we would like to know seem to fall into this category, especially answers to those most desperate questions of Why? and How long?\nAnd isn\u0026rsquo;t this at odds with what Jesus said?\n‚ÄúYou are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 15:14-15 All that Jesus has heard from our Heavenly Father he has made known. We must pause here, for isn\u0026rsquo;t this completely overwhelming in its relational depth? He has called you friend. He has called me friend. The very Son of God who died at Calvary to rescue and redeem the whole world, the Word of Life through whom the universe was made and who sustains it through each moment by his powerful word, this one calls you and me both friend.\nSpend a few moments here to savour that intimacy in relationship. In our craving to know things, perhaps we have overlooked our wonderful Saviour whom we can know, who has made himself known. For Jesus said,\n‚ÄúAnd you know the way to where I am going.‚Äù Thomas said to him, ‚ÄúLord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:4-7 Not only can we know our wonderful Saviour, but we can know the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. Again, listen to Jesus.\n‚ÄúIf you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:15-17 And not only this, but we can also know that we are in Jesus, for he said exactly that.\n‚ÄúYet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:19-20 Isn\u0026rsquo;t the truth that so much has been made known that we are in danger of being overwhelmed by it all? For that is absolutely how we should be feeling!\nBut what of those secret things which belong to the Lord our God? Here\u0026rsquo;s one, for example, about that glorious day on which Jesus will come again.\n‚ÄúBut in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 13:24-27_ Isn\u0026rsquo;t this in truth what we long for most?\nThen I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‚ÄúBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 21:1-4 When will this be, this most eagerly anticipated day of them all? Jesus says this.\n‚ÄúBut concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 13:32 Jesus himself does not know it! This is surely one of the most secret things of them all.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s insight to be gained here over those lesser secrets‚∏∫those matters which so profoundly affect our own lives. O my soul, as you wait on the Lord for his good and faithful promise to be fulfilled, not knowing when or why or how but choosing to surrender to his wisdom and his sovereignty, notice what we do know about that day when Jesus will return, coming on the clouds with great power and glory. It will be the very best day of any of our lives, when all that has been so long awaited will be fulfilled by the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nAnd so it is for all those other secret things. Do not doubt the goodness of the one who holds back on Why? or How long? or even How? But simply trust, and wait with eager anticipation and full assurance for that lesser day which will surely come before that greatest of days.\nO my soul, do not crave to know the secret things which belong to the Lord our God, but trust him on those, and rejoice in these wonderful things which have been revealed which belong to you! üôè\n","date":"2025-04-11T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/secrets/tim-evans-Uf-c4u1usFQ-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3779494_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/secrets/","title":"Secrets"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow on earth will you walk before the Lord and be blameless?\nWhen Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.‚Äù Then Abram fell on his face.\n‚Äï Genesis 17:1-3a Recall why Abraham fell on his face. Despite holding that impossible promise from the Lord for all those years, his life had been defined by cowardice and lies and failure and shame. He was at this time living with the consequence of having tried to fulfil that promise in his own strength, by fathering a child with the slave-girl Hagar. And I\u0026rsquo;m quite sure he enjoyed that at the time, having sex with the youthful Egyptian slave-girl rather than his ancient wife. But not now. Not when confronted with his sin and his shame and his failure by the Holy God.\nAfter thirteen long years of living with the mess of that shameful failure all together in close proximity in that dysfunctional household,\nWhen Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 17:1 Abraham was overwhelmed by his own sin and shame and wretchedness, and when confronted by the holiness of God and his command, ‚ÄúWalk before me, and be blameless,‚Äù he fell on his face. There is nothing else he could have done.\nAnd whatever your situation, whatever shameful failure lies in your own past, and whatever the stumbling in more recent times, this is also addressed to you. It is exactly that to which each one of us is called.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:3-4 This has been chosen for you, but how on earth will you walk before this Holy God yourself and be holy and blameless? You must do this if you would enjoy his strong support!\nFor the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 16:9a But isn\u0026rsquo;t this all too much to ask of an unholy people? By no means!\nFirstly, the Creator God of the Universe chose each one of us in Christ, even before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him. He chose you for this and he chose me. You and I both must surrender to the choice of the one who is wise and strong and who knows how to achieve his plans and purposes.\nListen to Job\u0026rsquo;s profession of faith after he had been confronted by the overwhelming greatness and majesty of God.\nThen Job answered the LORD and said: ‚ÄúI know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.‚Äù\n‚Äï Job 42:1-2 The same overwhelmingly great and majestic God has a purpose for you and for me both, that we should be holy and blameless before him. So cry out to him along with the psalmist.\nI cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfils his purpose for me.\n‚Äï Psalm 57:2 And do not think you can resist the irresistible.\nMany are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.\n‚Äï Proverbs 19:21 So you must surrender your life to the Holy Spirit as he does his sanctifying work in you. Resistance is futile.\nBut how? How can unholy creatures be made holy? The answer is found only in Jesus.\nAnd you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.\n‚Äï Colossians 1:21-23 He has reconciled each one to himself in Christ\u0026rsquo;s body and by his death in order to present each one holy and blameless and above reproach before him. So do not shift from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, but which may not just now be in the forefront of your mind. Make it so!\nBut how? How can we become holy, even according to his purposes? His strong and sure work of grace in our lives? If you desire this end, you must set your heart upon it. But isn\u0026rsquo;t it all just too hard? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it seem to be?\nFor I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.\n‚Äï Romans 7:18 This is what I am up against. So how then can I co-operate with the Spirit of Christ in being transformed and made holy? Simply by noticing this: the strong connection between blamelessness and love.\nNow may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 3:11-13 May the Lord himself make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all precisely so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father. Oh my!\nAnd it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:9-11 Love that abounds more and more is the way to become pure and blameless for the day of Christ, and also quite remarkably how to fulfil the law.\nLove does no wrong to a neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.\n‚Äï Romans 13:10 It is the power of love that will transform each one, and this fruit of righteousness comes only through Jesus. So set your course with determination to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.\nAnd even as you wait on the Lord, even as you cry out to him through these long years of waiting, walk before him and be blameless.\nI will sing of steadfast love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will make music. I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house.\n‚Äï Psalm 101:1-2 Can you hear the waiting and the longing here? Oh when will you come to me?\nBut above all, know that you will only be able to do any of this because of Jesus.\nNow to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever.

I know you are.\nSo what of this?\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 But is your way not already fully committed? You know that it is! Do you not already trust him utterly and completely? You know that you do!\nDid he then act? No he did not.\nAnd what of these words of Jesus?\nAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?

If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.\n‚Äï John 14:12-14 Did you not already ask in his name, understanding full well the requirement to put aside self-interest and pray the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own heart? Yes, you did, in faith and humility and complete confidence in him. And did he do it? No he did not.\nAnd what about what he said after cursing that fig tree?\nWhen the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, ‚ÄúHow did the fig tree wither at once?‚Äù And Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‚ÄòBe taken up and thrown into the sea,‚Äô it will happen. And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 21:20-22 O my soul, do you have faith? I know you do. And having cast yourself upon the Lord so completely, having trusted him with your very life, having believed and not doubted, having grown into possessing a faith that could so nearly move that mountain, where does that leave you in relation to these firm assurances?

Will you give up trusting? Will you give up waiting? Will you give up believing?\nOr will you continue in your walk of faith and hope and trust in the Lord? Which you choose is a matter of life and death. O my soul, make no mistake here. Your very life depends upon it!\nSo you must cry out with Job,\nThough he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face.\n‚Äï Job 13:15 You must hope in him, for there is no other. But argue your ways to his face. You must do this. He can take it. Are the psalms not full of it?\nAnd in the silence and the emptiness and the bewilderment and the heartbreak perhaps you have two questions for the Lord. Cry out to God with these two questions: Why? And how long?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with why.\nBut know that the question of why is confronted head on by the Lord\u0026rsquo;s rebuke of Job. A rebuke that came after a prolonged period of suffering. A prolonged period of waiting. A prolonged period of dismay and bewilderment. The rebuke came throughout Job chapters 38-42 and could be summarised like this: ‚ÄúI am the LORD Most High, Creator of Heaven and Earth. And who are you exactly?‚Äù\nO my soul, do not think that you are owed any explanation for you are not. You are a grasshopper before the Lord of Hosts. Surrender that spirit of entitlement that demands you understand why. For you do not and you cannot know these things.\nThe secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 29:29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God.\nNevertheless even though he was denied his explanation of why, Job was commended for pleading his case before the Lord.\nAfter the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ‚ÄúMy anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.‚Äù\n‚Äï Job 42:7 So you must continue to argue your ways to the Lord, to his face. You must!\nAnd notwithstanding the absence of any real explanation we may know that a profound work is taking place. Is this not precisely what is revealed?\nIn this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith‚∏∫more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire‚∏∫may be found to result in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 1:6-7 The time of silence and emptiness is a trial like no other. You must pass this test. Your faith is more precious than gold. Nurture that faith!\nAnd recall how Jesus ended his summing up of his parable of the persistent widow.\nNevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\n‚Äï Luke 18:8b O my soul, will he find faith in your own heart, faith more precious than gold? If he does know that there will be praise and honour and glory.\nThe second question was Habakkuk\u0026rsquo;s own heart-cry.\nO LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear?\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:2 How long, O Lord? We have asked this before. And as before we may rejoice in the answer spoken to Habakkuk by the Lord, the everlasting God, the Holy One.\nLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 Be assured that the Lord is indeed doing a great work, a wondrous work, a mighty work which cannot be told. It is a work of faithfulness and power. It is a good and kind work. It is a healing work. It is a work of deliverance and the fulfillment of promises. It is such a work that you would not believe if told!\nSo what will you do? You must do as Abraham was commanded, after his own waiting time of twenty-four years. Twenty-four years of waiting on the Lord for the fulfilment of that impossible promise. Twenty-four years of bewilderment. A time during which he had wrestled and struggled and stumbled badly. Perhaps you too have stumbled. But nevertheless,\nWhen Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 17:1 O my soul, you must walk before the Lord and be blameless. The integrity with which you live your life is of the utmost importance. In this bewildering time of waiting, your own personal holiness will be life and health and strength both for you and for others. To walk before the Lord means to live in his presence, in the context of his goodness and kindness and faithfulness and all that he has promised.\nO my soul, hold on to hope and trust in the Lord, walk before him and be blameless! üôè\n","date":"2025-03-28T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/when-god-does-not-act/neom-GoLWB4p8JXw-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_8031395_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/when-god-does-not-act/","title":"When God does not act"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow are you going with your holiness and repudiation of worldliness?\nAre you embarrassed, ashamed even, of how feeble is your ability to live a right life which honours the Lord? Are you occasionally skewered by thoughts which take you to places you know you should not go, and in fact later you bitterly regret visiting? Do you find yourself stumbling? Again?\nKnow that you are not alone.\nFor I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.\n‚Äï Romans 7:15 This was written by the Apostle Paul, the very same man who had encountered Jesus personally and dramatically on the Damascus Road. The same man who had been taken up into the third heaven, into paradise, to hear things which man may not utter, however we grapple to understand that.\nI know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven‚∏∫whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into paradise‚∏∫whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows‚∏∫and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 Paul knows this man in Christ for it is himself.\nAnd yet after these amazing encounters and being filled with the Holy Spirit now we find Paul writing this, and in the present tense no less.\nFor I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.\n‚Äï Romans 7:15 So here is Paul struggling with the very same.\nThe first thing we must do is acknowledge that the spiritual battle is real and that it must be fought every day. Every single day.\nAnd then we must be wise to what we are up against. Again, listen to Paul.\nFor I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.\n‚Äï Romans 7:18-19 O my soul, do you somehow think that you have the ability to do that which was beyond the apostle?\nSo I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.\n‚Äï Romans 7:21-23 Christians through the ages have struggled to understand what Paul is saying here, for does it not seem to be both defeatist and without hope? It is neither of these things. It is gritty reality, the astute observation of one for whom there is no pretending, and the humble acknowledgement of the extent to which the hooks of sin remain in one\u0026rsquo;s life even after eternal salvation has been secured by Christ\u0026rsquo;s death and resurrection.\nIf there is a war being waged then it must be fought. But it must be fought with the right weapons and in the grace of God. Let us first recognise that which is our own responsibility.\nFor those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.\n‚Äï Romans 8:5-6 O my soul, what is your mind set upon? The Lord knows! And it is this which is the key to victory in the spiritual battle for our own holiness‚∏∫earnest desire to honour the Lord in every last detail of our lives, and a longing for that which is good, right, and true to have the victory over sin in our lives.\nAnd then what? Well then we must fully engage with Paul\u0026rsquo;s argument, for it is hope and strength and life and peace to each one burdened by ongoing and besetting sin.\nNow if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.\nNow if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.\n‚Äï Romans 7:16-17, 20 It is precisely that earnest desire to live a right life in humble gratitude to my saviour that is evidence of this: I am not my sin! It no longer defines me. And so along with Paul and with a grateful heart I can declare:\nWretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.\n‚Äï Romans 7:24-25 Only through Jesus\u0026rsquo; death and resurrection can I be delivered from this wretched state. Praise my Saviour!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more. Much more.\nThere is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\n‚Äï Romans 8:1-4 Here is the victory. It is in Christ and it is Christ. And for those who are in Christ there is no condemnation. Instead there is freedom‚∏∫freedom in Christ. Hallelujah!\nThe tension between the flesh and the Spirit remains but notice that the Lord has condemned sin in the flesh. He did this in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in each one of us, that is, in order that each one of us may become holy.\nAnd furthermore notice this phenomenal promise.\nBut if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.\n‚Äï Romans 8:10-11 This is nothing if not a promise of sanctification through the indwelling Spirit of Christ Jesus. These very mortal bodies which are dead because of sin will be given life. Victory over sin is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s gift of grace, the sanctifying work of the Spirit. Yes, it is utterly beyond us, but it is not beyond him.\nSo what are we to do when we stumble? Simply cry out to the Lord in anguish over our ongoing sin, confess that sin, repent, and receive forgiveness and restoration.\nO my soul, even when you stumble, especially when you stumble, repent, set your mind on the things of the Spirit, be lifted up once more, and by doing so choose life and peace! üôè\n","date":"2025-03-21T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/humbled-by-stumbling/k-mitch-hodge-IqSaG9zv2e0-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3153638_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/humbled-by-stumbling/","title":"Humbled by stumbling"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHave you accepted worldliness into your life?\nOf course the answer is yes. For now though let\u0026rsquo;s leave to one side how or what to do and let\u0026rsquo;s simply consider the great cost that you have suffered and will continue to suffer because of this.\nConsider King Asa of Judah about whom we read this.\nAbijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years. And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.\nThe heart of Asa was wholly true all his days.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 14:1-2, 15:17b Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t we be inclined to rank Asa among the upright and true kings, one of so very few men of integrity along with Hezekiah and Josiah and David himself? Of course we would and he is even commended for it. So why is he my example of worldliness? Exactly for this reason in fact, that he was otherwise upright and true. And may his life serve as a solemn warning to any who might consider themselves also to be upright and true, living a life of integrity and honouring the Lord.\nFor what do we find in his later years?\nIn the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 16:1 Baasha king of Israel was undeniably evil.\nIn the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 15:33-34 Not only was Baasha evil but he had a reputation for destruction.\nAnd as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. It was for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned and that he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 15:29-30 So what was good king Asa to do? Was he to suffer the same fate as the house of Jeroboam? Not if he could help it!\nThen Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king\u0026rsquo;s house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying, ‚ÄúThere is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.‚Äù\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 16:2-3 This was the same king who had faced an Ethiopian army twice the size of his own, who had cried out to God and been miraculously delivered.\nZerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. And Asa cried to the LORD his God, ‚ÄúO LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you.‚Äù So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 14:9-12 Asa had cried out to the Lord who had defeated the Ethiopians before him. And yet now we find him raiding the treasures of the temple of the Lord to use as a bribe for Ben-hadad king of Syria, to deliver him from the hand of Baasha.\nHow could this be? How could this good and upright king whose heart was wholly true all his days behave in such a faithless and godless way?\nO my soul, know that I scoured three chapters of the Chronicles for evidence of an explanation, and found only this.\nAnd [Asa] gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. They sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep. And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul, but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.\nBut the high places were not taken out of Israel.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 15:9-13, 17 We must understand the significance of these high places which were not taken out.\nAnd Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.\n‚Äï 1 Kings 14:22-24 These high places were an abomination from the time before the Lord\u0026rsquo;s people were given the land of Canaan. They were the epitome of worldliness, and yet they were tolerated, remaining in the land, tainting and corrupting the Children of the Promise, and if I am right, becoming the downfall of Asa, that otherwise good, right, and true king.\nAnd what a tragic end he consequently suffered, this king whose heart was nevertheless wholly true all his days.\nAt that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, ‚ÄúBecause you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you. Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand. For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is whole toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars.‚Äù\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 16:7-9 Furthermore Asa did not respond well to this rebuke from the Lord.\nThen Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.\nThe acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians. And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 16:10-13 What a tragic end to an otherwise right and true life. And what a solemn and sober warning to those who might be following Asa into worldliness.\nAsa had been warned so clearly, but perhaps in his complacency he had failed to take the warning seriously.\nThe Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded, and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, ‚ÄúHear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.‚Äù\n‚Äï 2 Chronicles 15:1-2 The Lord looks throughout the whole earth for those whose hearts are wholly for him, and he gives them strong support. Rejoice that he does so and be that wholehearted one!\nO my soul, be vigilant and purge the worldliness from your own life, for the Lord knows whose hearts are wholly for him, and he gives them strong support! üôè\n","date":"2025-03-14T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-perils-of-worldliness/engin-akyurt-pFv815lYZwc-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_4518968_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-perils-of-worldliness/","title":"The perils of worldliness"},{"content":"O my Soul,\nAre you still not enjoying being brushed aside and disregarded? Consider this.\nBefore destruction a man\u0026rsquo;s heart is haughty, but humility comes before honour.\n‚Äï Proverbs 18:12 In the original Hebrew the second simply says, humility before honour. How interesting. Humility before honour. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to that.\nBut firstly, before destruction a man\u0026rsquo;s heart is haughty. Haughty is somewhat of an old-fashioned word. What would be a more modern rendition? Conceited. Arrogant. Superior. Full of oneself. Prideful.\nThis then is about the greatest sin of them all: pride. And so the first part of this proverbial couplet is simply pride comes before a fall.\nThe LORD preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.\n‚Äï Psalm 31:23 What exactly did you suppose this repayment to comprise? Did you think it would be less than destruction? Did you think the fall would be anything other than divine judgment? Had you perhaps underestimated the severity of the sin of pride?\n‚ÄúScoffer‚Äù is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride.\n‚Äï Proverbs 21:24 Do not suppose that it is a small thing to carry the name of scoffer, nor something easily excused.\nWhoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer. The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind.\n‚Äï Proverbs 24:8-9 An abomination to mankind no less!\nFor the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up‚∏∫and it shall be brought low;\nAnd the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.\n‚Äï Isaiah 2:12, 17 This pride challenges the Lord himself. Do you wonder then that he will not tolerate it? For it displaces the Lord from his throne. It deceives and it defiles.\nAnd [Jesus] said, ‚ÄúWhat comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 7:20-23 What a shocking list, and pride is right there in the thick of it. But what else did Jesus say?\nBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\n‚Äï Matthew 5:5 So let\u0026rsquo;s return to our proverb in the context of inheriting the earth.\nHumility before honour.\n‚Äï Proverbs 18:12b The word for honour is k√¢b√¥d, although this is a word mostly not translated honour. Mostly not.\nThe fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom, and humility comes before honour.\n‚Äï Proverbs 15:33 The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honour and life.‚Å†\n‚Äï Proverbs 22:4 One\u0026rsquo;s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honour.\n‚Äï Proverbs 29:23 Job uses the same word in speaking of what he has received from the Lord.\nHe has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head.\n‚Äï Job 19:9 As does the psalmist.\nBut you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.\n‚Äï Psalm 3:3 Marvel at this word k√¢b√¥d. For far more than honour is it translated glory.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúThis very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favour in my sight, and I know you by name.‚Äù Moses said, ‚ÄúPlease show me your glory.‚Äù\nThe LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.\n‚Äï Exodus 33:17-18, 34:5-8 Marvel at the glory of the Lord and marvel further that this same word k√¢b√¥d is used for it!\nLift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory!\n‚Äï Psalm 24:7-10 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:\n‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:1-3 The Lord will not tolerate the pride that challenges his own exaltation, his own glory, and yet he bestows honour and glory upon the meek and humble‚∏∫glory carried in the same word as his very own!\nThis bestowing of honour is seen so clearly in the echo of the psalmist.\nThe LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens! Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high, who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people. He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!\n‚Äï Psalm 113:4-9 Here is k√¢b√¥d which is the glory of the Lord. And the echo is in Hannah\u0026rsquo;s prayer‚∏∫Hannah, that barren woman whose womb was opened by the Lord, making her the joyous mother of Samuel, the Lord\u0026rsquo;s prophet.\nAnd Hannah prayed and said,\n‚ÄúThe LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.

Do you desire to see the Lord? Because in fact this is the very same question.\nStrive \u0026hellip; for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:14 Make no mistake. Without holiness you will not see the Lord.\nThere are several words for holiness in the New Testament. The holiness without which no-one will see the Lord is hagiasmos, which means purity, or consecration, or sanctification.\nDo you desire this then? You had better, for the Lord desires it of you!\nFor this is the will of God, your sanctification.\nFor God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 4:3, 7-8 The words translated here as sanctification and holiness are the very same.\nWhat is this then to which we are called? It is about putting on a whole new self.\nNow this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. But that is not the way you learned Christ!‚∏∫assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:17-24 The old self is corrupt through deceitful desires. They are deceitful because they claim to lead to satisfaction and contentment but in fact they lead to death and destruction. Beware these deceitful desires! But the new self is created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. O my soul, you must put on this new self, and find satisfaction and contentment and joy in it.\nPutting on the new self is so important that Paul lists with exceeding clarity in several places exactly what are its consequences, highlighting the stark contrast between the new self and the old self. For example:\nBut I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\n‚Äï Galatians 5:16-21 But we must be so careful in approaching these lists of Paul\u0026rsquo;s, because we are absolutely not called to box-ticking, as if we could somehow measure up. So let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can understand the main point here.\nFirstly, recognize the battle that is being waged in the inner being. The desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other. Paul expands upon this in his letter to the Romans.\nFor we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.\nSo I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.\n‚Äï Romans 7:14-15, 21-23 The situation appears to be desperate, and for the one who would honour the Lord through living a life of personal holiness it seems to be hopeless. This must be both acknowledged and then repudiated.\nWretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!\n‚Äï Romans 7:24-25 There is victory through Jesus and only through him. There is simply no other way to achieve this holiness. And so what must fuel this desire for holiness is humility and a grateful heart.\nGod chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 1:28-31 There is no badge of honour in living a holy life. That idea is straight out of the Pharisaical heart. The holy life is evidence of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s victory over the sin in our lives, and the glory is his alone. Praise him!\nO my soul, weep in gratitude to your Saviour and Redeemer, who alone has the power to transform you in this way. And know that the transformation is a matter of life and death. For how does Paul conclude his shocking list?\nI warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\n‚Äï Galatians 5:21b Conversely, know that you will never earn your own way in this regard. And rejoice in this blessed truth:\nBut if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.\n‚Äï Galatians 5:18 Do you understand what it means to be led by the Spirit? Recall what I wrote previously about this, based on the insight of J.I. Packer. Being led by the Spirit is about putting to death the deeds of the body and not gratifying the desires of the flesh. It is all about the power of the sanctified will. This has nothing to do with understanding or insight! It is about doing rather than discerning.\nWe absolutely must learn to live in this power, to surrender our unholy wills to the holy and righteous will of God. This is the very crux of the spiritual battle! The life of personal holiness must be an outworking of gratitude and love and worship to our rescuer, the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nNone of us could possibly live up to the law and attain any of this. But rejoice because that is not what we are called to do. Those who are led by the Spirit, who have surrendered their will to the Lord to live in submission and humility are not under the law.

Do you long for rescue? Do you long for deliverance? Then cry out to God. And as you do, trust in him. Trust him completely. For there is a terrible pitfall for those who long for healing, for deliverance, for change, and it is this: to think that you can make it happen yourself.\nThus says the LORD: ‚ÄúCursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD. He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.‚Äù\n‚Äï Jeremiah 17:5-6 Do not think for a moment that you\u0026rsquo;ve got this. It is completely beyond you. You must repudiate that rugged individualism that says you can make it by yourself, for once you start down that road of self-reliance and independence you will gradually become locked in to that way of thinking‚∏∫a shrub in the desert trying to tough it out in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited and uninhabitable salt land. Self-reliance and dependence on God are mutually exclusive. The rugged little shrub in the desert thinks less and less about the Lord and his power to save, and more and more about itself and how to survive, and inevitably its heart turns away from the Lord.\nIs that what you want? For there is another way.\n‚ÄúBlessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit.‚Äù\n‚Äï Jeremiah 17:7-8 To be that tree planted by water, you must not only trust in the Lord, but your trust must be the Lord. Understand what that means. It is trust that is all in, fully committed, as if your very life depends on it, because it does.\nNotice something here. The tree planted by the water is not anxious in the year of drought for it does not cease to bear fruit. The Lord uses for his Kingdom purposes even the one crying out for deliverance. The one who trusts in the Lord does not cease to bear fruit, and there is enormous affirmation in that. What a testimony to the grace and power of God. His power is made perfect in our weakness and his grace is fully sufficient.\nAnd notice too the parallel between the tree of life standing on the river of life whose leaves are for the healing of the nations, and this tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and whose leaves remain green. Are you starting to understand the magnitude of the blessing for the one who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord? It is simply astonishing. The power and grace are completely overwhelming.\nFinally, notice what must be in that place of desperate longing for healing, for rescue, for change.\nHeal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.\n‚Äï Jeremiah 17:14 For you, O Lord, are my praise. This is what must be, and you must ensure to make it so.\nO my soul, never stop crying out to the Lord for rescue and deliverance, and in that place of longing, be sure to make him your praise! üôè\n","date":"2025-02-21T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/nils-leonhardt-Tss1uOMczDg-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_4281503_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/","title":"Heal me O Lord!"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you long for the healing of the nations?\nLook around the world.

Isn\u0026rsquo;t it all hopeless?\nBy no means! Or did you forget about the tree of life?\nThen the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n‚Äï Revelation 22:1-2 Do not forget the tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations.\nBut first, be grateful that the Lord is so very aware of the great need for this healing.\nIs not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:6-7 If you were thinking that the Lord is ignorant of or indifferent to our broken world, think again. And what is needed if not complete healing? Know that the leaves of the tree of life are sufficient for this.\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s vision here in Revelation is remarkably foreshadowed by Ezekiel\u0026rsquo;s vision of the new temple, given more than 600 years previously during the Babylonian exile.\nThen he led me to the gate, the gate facing east. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory. And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face. As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 43:1-5 What are we to make of this? The world\u0026rsquo;s leading scholars regard these few chapters in Ezekiel as among most difficult to comprehend in the whole of Scripture. And yet, let it simply transport us into the presence of God. Behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple. Praise his holy name! And with the prophet, fall on your face in reverant awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.\nThen he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 47:1-2 What is this trickle of water issuing from below the threshold of the temple, from the place filled by the glory of the Lord? Is it not the very river of life itself?\nGoing on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. And he said to me, ‚ÄúSon of man, have you seen this?‚Äù\n‚Äï Ezekiel 47:3-6 O my soul, have you seen this? Does it thrill your heart?\nThen he led me back to the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. And he said to me, ‚ÄúThis water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea.‚Äù\n‚Äï Ezekiel 47:6-8a The river is flowing through the Arabah, the plains of Jericho, and into the Dead Sea, a place so hostile to life that nothing can live there. Is this not so like our broken world, a place so hostile to the life that God created that it seems nothing good can live in it, nothing good can flourish, none can thrive?\nBut what happens when the river of life flows in?\nWhen the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh. And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 47:8b-9 Everything will live where the river goes. The to us overwhelming suffering, hatred, and indifference of our broken world cannot resist the refreshing and renewing power of the river of life.\nAnd on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 47:12 The water for them flows from the sanctuary, from the place where God dwells, from the giver of life himself. What a foreshadowing of John\u0026rsquo;s vision here in Revelation of the tree of life standing on the river of life, with its twelve kinds of fruit yielding its fruit each month. And,\nThe leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n‚Äï Revelation 22:2b Ezekiel saw that wherever this river flowed life flourished. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the Lord, the giver of life. O my soul, this is an outpouring of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s grace and healing power, and it is sufficient.\nAnd the angel said to John,\n‚ÄúThese words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 22:6 And Jesus himself said,\n‚ÄúAnd behold, I am coming soon.

And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n‚Äï Genesis 2:8-9 Interestingly and quite unlike the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there were no prohibitions concerning the tree of life, at least initially.\nThe LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, ‚ÄúYou may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 2:15-17 Adam and Eve were free to eat of the tree of life but we soon learn that they did not avail themselves of that opportunity. O my soul, weep over the inclination of the human heart to pursue that which is forbidden, that which is evil, that which leads only to death and destruction. It is perverse in the extreme. It is called sin.\nNow the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made.\nHe said to the woman, ‚ÄúDid God actually say, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of any tree in the garden?‚Äô‚Äù And the woman said to the serpent, ‚ÄúWe may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.‚Äô‚Äù But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.\n‚Äï Genesis 3:1-7 This was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and so in this simple act of disobedience, this first act of rebellion against their creator, innocence died and evil came into the human heart and into the world.\nO my soul, grieve over how different the world would have been today if they had eaten instead from the tree of life which was allowed, and not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which was forbidden. The consequences were severe indeed.\nThen the LORD God said, ‚ÄúBehold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever‚∏∫‚Äù therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.\n‚Äï Genesis 3:22-24 Two trees and the tragedy of a wrong choice. All seemed lost and the tree of life was now out of reach.\nBut there was a third tree. O my soul, rejoice that there was a third tree.\nFor to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.‚ÄØHe committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 2:21-24 The third tree stood at Calvary, and on that darkest of days our Saviour gave up his own life for the sake of all humankind. For us, the rebels.\nRecall what the Lord had said to Adam when evicting him from that perfect garden, and marvel in gratitude at the magnitude of what was being undone.\nAnd to Adam he said, ‚ÄúBecause you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 3:17 That was the beginning. Here is the end.\n\u0026hellip; on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.\n‚Äï Revelation 22:2-3 And this was the cost.\nChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us‚∏∫for it is written, ‚ÄúCursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree‚Äù\n‚Äï Galatians 3:13 Not only are we redeemed from the curse of the law but so too is the whole world‚∏∫this broken and hurting world. The tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit, and twelve means complete. And its leaves are for the healing of the nations‚∏∫the healing of this nation, and each one like it.\nNow recall what Jesus said to the church at Ephesus, where some had lost their way.\nTo the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.\n‚ÄòHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

In these lay a multitude of invalids‚∏∫blind, lame, and paralyzed. One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, ‚ÄúDo you want to be healed?‚Äù\n‚Äï John 5:2-6 Isn\u0026rsquo;t that already a confronting question?\nO my soul, do you want to be healed? It is Jesus who is asking.\nWhy this question?\nConsider the man in the story, an invalid for thirty-eight years. Surely at this stage in his life, his affliction had become part of his identity. Was he prepared to give that up? Would he know who he was if he were well? Did he even want to be healed?\nOr consider other kinds of affliction. Some live in pain. So much pain. Ongoing pain. Exquisite pain. Pain that has become part of life, like an old friend. Almost comforting. Part of their identity. And so perhaps almost subconsciously they choose to continue in that pain rather than to be healed, establishing patterns of thought and behaviour which become their own prison.\nO my soul, do you even want to be healed?\nThe sick man answered him, ‚ÄúSir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúGet up, take up your bed, and walk.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 5:7-8 Notice the sick man\u0026rsquo;s justification of his ongoing affliction. Didn\u0026rsquo;t he make his own plight out to be inevitable? But Jesus wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in his excuses or his justification.\n‚ÄúGet up, take up your bed, and walk.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 5:8 And so the sick man was immediately confronted with two questions. Did he want to be healed, and did he believe Jesus could do that for him? For what is the prerequisite for receiving healing if not faith?\nObserve what happened on a different occasion.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30 According to your faith be it done to you. We have been here before and quite recently.\nO my soul, this remains Jesus\u0026rsquo; question to you. ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù And if your answer is, yes Lord, and you even want to be healed then simply pick up your mat and walk.\nBut perhaps this question of faith challenges you. Perhaps it is too much. Perhaps this obstacle is defeating you. If so, there is good news.\nAnd behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.\n‚Äï Luke 5:18-19 Wow! I wonder what the home-owner thought of the actions of this man\u0026rsquo;s faithful friends, breaking through the roof of his house. They clearly didn\u0026rsquo;t care about that!\nAnd when he saw their faith, he said, ‚ÄúMan, your sins are forgiven you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.‚Äù And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.\n‚Äï Luke 5:20, 24b-25 Jesus healed this man when he saw the faith of his friends. That was enough.\nSo this is how you answer Jesus\u0026rsquo; question, do you want to be healed? Get up, pick up your mat, and walk. Will you do this? It is your articulation of faith and hope in the only Son of God, the risen Lord Jesus, infinite in power and splendour, who stands at the door and knocks. And if you lack the faith to believe for yourself, rest upon the faith of your friends.\nAnd what of those who have imprisoned themselves in debilitating patterns of thought and behaviour, having adopted that ongoing and exquisite pain as part of their very identity? The answer for them is what Jesus spoke at the beginning of his earthly ministry, and it is a joyous and liberating and life-giving answer.\nAnd the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\n‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 4:17-19 O my soul, this is the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\nAnd what became of the man in our story, the invalid of thirty-eight years?\nAnd at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.\n‚Äï John 5:9 The psalmist knew what was required to receive blessing and healing from the Lord.\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 O my soul, commit your way to the Lord, trust in him, and pick up your mat and walk! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2025-01-24T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/pick-up-your-mat/davidsonluna-yOzIE5VTEpo-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_6808366_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/pick-up-your-mat/","title":"Pick up your mat"},{"content":"O my soul,\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t the parable of the persistent widow just so very uncomfortable?\nAnd he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. He said, ‚ÄúIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‚ÄòGive me justice against my adversary.‚Äô For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‚ÄòThough I neither fear God nor respect man, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.‚Äô‚Äù And the Lord said, ‚ÄúHear what the unrighteous judge says. And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 18:1-8 Here was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man, who only gave the widow what she was asking for to stop her bothering him.\nLuke tells us precisely why Jesus told this parable, that we should persist in prayer and not lose heart. The parable provides insight into this. The persistent widow is me, crying out to God day and night, and the unrighteous judge is God himself‚∏∫Father, Creator, Lord of All. And here\u0026rsquo;s what is so uncomfortable, so jarring. The character representing God in this parable is an unrighteous judge who cared only that the widow stop bothering him.\nIs this how the Lord receives the prayers of his beloved ones, our prayers? By no means!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first see how precious to the Lord are the prayers of his saints, us, our prayers. And for that we must look into the throne room of heaven itself.\nAnd between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.\n‚Äï Revelation 5:6-8 Here is the Lamb who was slain, the risen Lord Jesus, with eyes like a flame of fire, feet like burnished bronze, a voice like the roar of many waters, and his face like the sun shining in full strength. Praise him!\nAnd here in the throne room around the Lamb are the twenty-four elders holding those golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints‚∏∫our prayers. What next?\nWhen the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.\n‚Äï Revelation 8:1-4 See how precious to the Lord are the prayers of the saints. They are offered on the golden altar before the throne in heaven, and are a pleasing aroma to the Lord.\nSo it would be a terrible mistake to infer something of the character of God from the unrighteous judge in the parable. That is not what the parable is about and that is not what it means. To make such an inference would be an example of attributing meaning beyond what is intended, and yet people make that mistake all the time. How often have you heard criticism of the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son over how he must have treated the elder son? But the father represents our Heavenly Father! That is not what the parable is about and the criticism is out of place.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s a bigger problem with the parables than inferring beyond what they teach and it is this, which Jesus explained to his disciples in the context of the parable of the sower.\nThen the disciples came and said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to them in parables?‚Äù And he answered them, ‚ÄúTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 13:10-13 Can this be right? That the reason Jesus spoke in parables was to inhibit understanding? Didn\u0026rsquo;t he come to seek and save the lost? What could this possibly mean?\nJesus continued by quoting Isaiah.\nIndeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:\n‚ÄúYou will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.‚Äù For this people\u0026rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 13:14-15 I have wrestled with this prophecy of Isaiah before. But here I have noticed something significant. Read carefully Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s original prophecy.\nAnd [the voice of the Lord] said, ‚ÄúGo, and say to this people: ‚ÄòKeep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.‚Äô Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:9-10 The voice of the Lord is full of imperatives. Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. Something is being done to this people and it is most uncomfortable. But Jesus is Lord of All, God before time, and fully able to clarify this. Notice how he quotes from Isaiah.\nFor this people\u0026rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed.\n‚Äï Matthew 13:15a The heart of those unable to comprehend the parables has grown dull and they have closed their own eyes.\nThere is mystery here and grappling must continue. But in the grappling notice the grace.\nBut blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\n‚Äï Matthew 13:16-17 O my soul, many have longed for what you have, for what you have received and seen and heard and understood. Are you sufficiently grateful?\nTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven.\n‚Äï Matthew 13:11 Notice too that the prophecy of Isaiah is not universal.\nThis is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Matthew 13:13-14a Hold on therefore to what you have, guard it jealously, and be grateful.\nSee what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.\n‚Äï 1 John 3:1a And finally notice how Jesus finished his parable of the persistent widow.\nNevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\n‚Äï Luke 18:8b When the Lord receives your prayers into his golden bowls in the throne room of heaven, will he find faith on earth? Will you pray in faith? And will you keep praying, believing and not doubting?\nO my soul, always pray and do not lose heart, and be grateful for the love of the Father, that we should be called children of God! üôè\n","date":"2025-01-17T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-problem-with-the-parables/dev-asangbam-sJipHSttNXo-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3235610_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-problem-with-the-parables/","title":"The problem with the parables"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHave you told Jesus what you want him to do for you?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not interested in ambition or covetousness or grasping or self-interest, and neither is he, but rather life and health and strength and deliverance and mercy. Have you told him what you want him to do for you?\nAs [Jesus] drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. They told him, ‚ÄúJesus of Nazareth is passing by.‚Äù And he cried out, ‚ÄúJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!‚Äù And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, ‚ÄúSon of David, have mercy on me!‚Äù And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 18:35-41a Isn\u0026rsquo;t this interesting? ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù This question was asked by the Word of Life himself, the omniscient Creator God.\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n‚Äï John 1:1-5, 14 Jesus already knew this blind man whose name was Bartimaeus. He knew his hopes and his dreams and his heartbreak and the debilitating affliction of his blindness. He was and is the giver of life itself, the one who knows and the one who loves and the one who heals, and yet, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù\nWhy would Jesus ask this? Consider Bartimaeus\u0026rsquo; answer and what happened next.\nHe said, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúRecover your sight; your faith has made you well.‚Äù And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.\n‚Äï Luke 18:41b-43 How much faith is articulated in that simple request, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight‚Äù? O my soul, if you would receive from Jesus you must believe. A previous encounter with two other blind men teaches us this.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30a O my soul, according to your faith be it done to you. Even if you are that desperate father of the boy with the unclean spirit.\n‚ÄúBut if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚Äú‚ÄòIf you can!‚Äô All things are possible for one who believes.‚Äù Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, ‚ÄúI believe; help my unbelief!‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 9:22-24 What do you want Jesus to do for you? If you believe that he can, you must ask him. Did Jesus not say as much?\nAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\n‚Äï Matthew 7:7 Before we finish, there\u0026rsquo;s something to notice from the context of the account of Bartimaeus\u0026rsquo; healing in Luke\u0026rsquo;s gospel. Do not overlook that the Bible was written under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit. It is hugely significant how the various accounts were assembled, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what else Luke put together here in what later became Chapter Eighteen of his gospel. There are five preceding paragraphs and they are all so very relevant.\nThe first is the parable of the persistent widow.\nAnd he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.\n‚Äï Luke 18:1 O my soul, don\u0026rsquo;t give up telling Jesus what you want him to do for you.\nThe second is the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector.\nFor everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\n‚Äï Luke 18:14 O my soul, you must ask Jesus as one crying out for mercy. You deserve nothing, so repudiate that spirit of entitlement which is always so eager to raise its head.\nThe third is of the little children whom the disciples rebuked.\nBut Jesus called them to him, saying, ‚ÄúLet the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 18:16-17 O my soul, be that little child and depend on Jesus. Has there ever been such an age as ours of rugged individualism? When Jesus asks, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù would you reply, ‚ÄúAh, I\u0026rsquo;m alright thanks Jesus, I\u0026rsquo;ve got this‚Äù?\nThe fourth is the tragic story of the rich young ruler.\nJesus \u0026hellip; said to him, ‚ÄúOne thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.‚Äù But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, ‚ÄúHow difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 18:22-25 O my soul, you must want Jesus and his Kingdom above all else. And do not overlook what Jesus said next.\nBut he said, ‚ÄúWhat is impossible with man is possible with God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 18:27 O my soul, do not hold back in what you ask Jesus to do for you, even if it seems impossible.\nAnd the fifth and final and by far the most important is Jesus again telling his disciples,\nSee, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.\n‚Äï Luke 18:31-33 O my soul, the very Son of God poured out his life for you on that cross at Calvary, and today and every day he pours out his love. His death paid in full both your own debt and that of all humankind. His resurrection is victory over sin and death and all that drags you down. Praise, O my soul, the King of Heaven!\nBartimaeus did not hold back in telling Jesus what he wanted him to do for him, and neither must you.\n‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúRecover your sight; your faith has made you well.‚Äù And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.\n‚Äï Luke 18:41-43 God is glorified when all the people see what Jesus does for humble sinners who ask in faith, believing and not doubting.\nO my soul, believe and do not doubt, and tell Jesus the full extent of what you want him to do for you! üôè\n","date":"2025-01-10T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/jj-ying-9Qwbfa_RM94-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3758013_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/","title":"What do you want me to do for you?"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is far more significant than the new year?\nThe answer is new mercy.\nThe steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:22-23 As I remarked previously the context of these verses is the destruction of Jerusalem after Nebuchadnezzar\u0026rsquo;s siege of a year-and-a-half, and the exile of Judah to Babylon‚∏∫the grimmest of times indeed, and moreover, the judgment of the Lord on his own people for their ongoing waywardness and apostasy. Enough was enough. But we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that.\nHere we have unceasing steadfast love and mercy, ch√™s√™d and racham, which so often go together and are surely the Lord\u0026rsquo;s most defining attributes as he revealed on Mount Sinai in response to Moses\u0026rsquo; request.\nMoses said, ‚ÄúPlease show me your glory.‚Äù\nThe LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.\n‚Äï Exodus 33:18, 34:5-8 In the face of such power and love and mercy, Moses\u0026rsquo; response was the only one possible.\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s description of himself was ch√™s√™d and racham and n√¢s√¢h, the last of which means forgiving, or so beautifully, lifting up.\nO my soul, take a breath right now and worship the Lord of Hosts, whose name is love and mercy and forgiveness!\nWe must not move past this revelation of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s character without noticing where it came in the sequence of events. Moses had previously been with the Lord on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights, during which time he received instruction on how the Israelites were to live to honour the Lord, which was written on those two tablets of stone.\nAnd he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.\n‚Äï Exodus 31:18 But what did Moses find when he descended from the mountain of God? The Israelites had made for themselves a golden calf which they worshipped. In dismay Moses threw the tablets to the ground and broke them, and directed the faithful remnant, the Levites, to strap on swords and execute their brothers and neighbours throughout the camp, about three thousand. More subsequently died of the plague sent by the Lord in judgment on his people.\nWhy is this relevant? Because of what happened next. Moses was instructed to make new tablets, and the Lord revealed himself again as the God of love and mercy and forgiveness and also vengeance.\nAnd he said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:10 And they were given instructions. Again. Including this. Again. O my soul, grieve that this was necessary.\nYou shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.\n‚Äï Exodus 34:17 But also, interestingly, this:\nYou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.\n‚Äï Exodus 34:25 which echoes in this:\nAnd the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.\n‚Äï Leviticus 7:15 The sacrifice was not to be left until the morning. But why not?\nThe answer is precisely where we came in.\nThe steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:22-23 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s mercy is new every morning. It is simply not appropriate that the sacrifice remain until the next morning because new mercy has flooded in and it is overwhelmingly sufficient.\nAnd what is new about this mercy? It is precisely because of the context of these verses‚∏∫the propensity of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s people to continue in their waywardness and apostasy, as it ever has been and still remains to this day. His mercy is new every morning and so very needed.\nO my soul, do not be deceived. There are two mistakes you must avoid. The first is to think that somehow your own heart is different from those Israelites, that you are somehow better. You are not. That propensity for waywardness and unbelief and sin remains, and so you must be vigilant and disciplined and repentant.\nThe second mistake is to doubt the sufficiency of that new mercy. But his mercy is more, and his mercy is new every morning! And his forgiveness is a lifting up anew.\nSo rejoice in the very next verse.\n‚ÄúThe LORD is my portion,‚Äù says my soul, ‚Äútherefore I will hope in him.‚Äù\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:24 The Lord is indeed my portion and my inheritance. He is all I need and therefore I will hope in him.\nAnd just as with Moses, there is only one possible response to this revelation of the character of God, and it is worship.\nBless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name! Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle\u0026rsquo;s.\n‚Äï Psalm 103:1-5 He crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, ch√™s√™d and racham. He crowns you!\nO my soul, worship the one who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, and put all your hope in him for this brave new year! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2025-01-03T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/new-mercy/karl-magnuson-HQR_JXd-fPs-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2111905_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/new-mercy/","title":"New mercy"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you think you have understood what the Lord is doing in your life?\nI suspect your level of understanding may be far less than you have thought. Consider Mary, hearing from the angel Gabriel standing right in front of her and speaking plainly.\nAnd the angel said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.‚Äù\nAnd Mary said to the angel, ‚ÄúHow will this be, since I am a virgin?‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Äï Luke 1:30-34 What a lot for her to take in! What did she actually understand? The most confronting element was surely that even as a virgin she would be having a baby, and this was evidently foremost in her mind. How much do you think she understood about the rest‚∏∫who he would be and what he would do? At this point in the story we cannot know.\nShortly afterwards her relative Elizabeth reminded her of what she had been told and affirmed her in it.\nAnd Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed \u0026hellip;\n‚Äú\u0026hellip; And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:41b-42a, 45 Who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to be reminded of what the Lord had said, and to be affirmed in receiving and believing it? O my soul, you must not neglect to remind of and to affirm in such things.\nAnd perhaps solely because of this affirmation and encouragement from Elizabeth was Mary able to go to the next level in understanding this impossible thing the Lord would do in her life.\nAnd Mary said, ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:46-49 Here we can see Mary just beginning to come to terms with the magnitude of what the Lord was doing in her and through her.\nBut she was still just beginning and her understanding was still so partial. Consider what happened on the night of Jesus\u0026rsquo; birth.\nAnd in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. And the angel said to them, ‚ÄúFear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!‚Äù\nWhen the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‚ÄúLet us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.‚Äù And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.\n‚Äï Luke 2:8-19 The word translated ponder here can mean combine, or come together, or confer with oneself. This was the third miraculous revelation, and Mary was still piecing things together.\nAnd it continued beyond this.\nAnd when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.\nNow there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, ‚ÄúLord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.‚Äù\nAnd his father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him.\n‚Äï Luke 2:22, 25-33 Now there have been four instances of miraculous revelation and still Mary is marvelling.\nShe couldn\u0026rsquo;t know yet but more than thirty years would pass before she would step up two more truly momentous levels in understanding, one heartbreaking and one joyous.\nSo they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother\u0026rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\n‚Äï John 19:16b-18, 25 Was Mary remembering those previous revelations? The hope and the joy of the world? Surely Simeon\u0026rsquo;s words spoken at Jesus\u0026rsquo; dedication in the temple would have come flooding back.\nAnd Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, ‚ÄúBehold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 2:34-35 Surely was her own soul pierced on this darkest of days. But something more was to be revealed to Jesus\u0026rsquo; disciples just days later after his glorious resurrection, and we can presume that Mary too climbed to that joyous level of understanding.\nThen he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, ‚ÄúThus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 24:45-47 So what may we conclude from Mary‚Äôs journey of incremental understanding, beginning with the angel standing before her and speaking plainly, and steadily increasing over a period of more than thirty years? O my soul, do not presume to think you have just now any more than a partial understanding of what the Lord is doing in your own life.\nLearn to surrender in praise and awe and wonder along with the Apostle Paul.\nOh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!\n‚Äï Romans 11:33 The reality is richer and deeper in every way, and will be revealed step by step as you trust and submit yourself to the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will with rejoicing in ever increasing surrender.\nAnd know that understanding is not as necessary as perhaps you had thought.\nDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:6-7 There is one more thing to know, and to hold on to in the inevitable and ongoing state of your own partial understanding, and that is that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s understanding is not partial. He knows and he understands and he is good beyond our own understanding, and that is enough.\nFor I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.\n‚Äï Jeremiah 29:11 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 O my soul, in humility and surrender know and accept that your own understanding is partial, so rest in these plans and purposes of the Lord and in his unfathomable peace! üôè\n","date":"2024-12-27T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/levels-of-understanding/juliana-malta-5MIe3FWAvoI-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3704669_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/levels-of-understanding/","title":"Levels of understanding"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat does this broken world need?\nWhat does Ukraine need? And Palestine? And Syria? And South Sudan? And the U.S.? And New Zealand?\nWhat do the downtrodden and the brokenhearted need? And O my soul, what do you need?\nThe answer is God\u0026rsquo;s rescue plan for this broken world and for each broken heart. But the answer has already come and it came in weakness and frailty and obscurity the form of a little baby.\nAnd Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.\n‚Äï Luke 2:4-7 What an inauspicious start to an incredible, lavish, and costly rescue‚∏∫a couple of nobodies away from home in a busy city with no place to stay, laying this newborn baby down in an animal\u0026rsquo;s food trough.\nBut perspective is everything.\nAnd in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. And the angel said to them, ‚ÄúFear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 2:8-12 As you marvel at the sheer audacity of sending a helpless baby to be the Saviour of the World, ensure to do so as Mary and not as Zechariah.\nAnd the angel said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.‚Äù\nAnd Mary said to the angel, ‚ÄúHow will this be, since I am a virgin?‚Äù\nAnd the angel answered her \u0026hellip;\nAnd Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:30-35, 38 This is at the same time so similar to and yet so very different from Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s response to a parallel revelation.\nBut the angel said to him, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.‚Äù\nAnd Zechariah said to the angel, ‚ÄúHow shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.‚Äù And the angel answered him, ‚ÄúI am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:13-14, 18-20 Notice that Mary\u0026rsquo;s question asked from her surrendered heart sounded to all intents and purposes just like Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s from his doubting heart, but it was in fact so very different. ‚ÄúHow will this be?‚Äù was asked in faith and obedience, whereas ‚ÄúHow shall I know this?‚Äù was asked in unbelief and scepticism.\nO my soul, you must be Mary.\n‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:38 So in hope and faith and with a surrendered heart, let us ask why and how. Why would the Creator God of the Universe and Lord of All choose such an apparently risky and fragile plan? And how could this helpless baby change everything?\nWhy?\nVitally Jesus was both fully man and fully God, but there is another factor here, and it is this.\nAnd the angel answered her \u0026hellip;\n‚ÄúFor nothing will be impossible with God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:35, 37 Is this not God demonstrating exactly this, revealing his great power made perfect in weakness? He is absolutely the God of the impossible. O my soul, he is the God of your own impossible. Consider even this one thing.\nHere we have a helpless newborn baby and a tyrant king out to kill him.\nThen Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, ‚ÄúGo and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.‚Äù\nThen Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.\n‚Äï Matthew 2:7-9, 16 And yet Mary and Joseph escaped with the baby Jesus to Egypt where they lived for a while as refugees in a foreign land. How was that even possible?\nSo the why is the God of the impossible demonstrating his great power, rescuing and redeeming his creation and the whole of humankind through this little baby. And how? Isaiah tells it and Handel composed it.\nFor to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n‚Äï Isaiah 9:6 This little baby would not remain weak and helpless. He was and is the great I Am, Mighty God, one with the Father, everlasting, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. The Prince of Peace indeed. Praise him! Praise his holy name!\nAnd never was the birth of a baby so anticipated, so eagerly awaited.\nThe people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil.\n‚Äï Isaiah 9:2-3 When the spoil is divided, all receive.\nSo what child is this? John tells it.\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n‚Äï John 1:1-5, 14 God the Son, the Creator of the Universe and the one who sustains all things by his powerful word, became flesh, became a little baby, and dwelt among us.\nKnow that all things were made through him and for him.\nHe is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities‚∏∫all things were created through him and for him.\n‚Äï Colossians 1:15-16 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever.

The chorus asserts ‚Äúall my life you have been faithful‚Äù, and verse two, ‚Äúyou have led me through the fire‚Äù.\nHave all who cherish this song really understood what this means? Through does not mean out of without first into.\nWhy would a faithful God lead me into the fire? And since this is just a song we have to ask, does Scripture even support this idea?\nHear the word of the Lord through Isaiah.\nFor my name\u0026rsquo;s sake I defer my anger; for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off. Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction. For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.\n‚Äï Isaiah 48:9-11 Who are these whom the Lord has refined in the furnace of affliction? Isaiah tells us.\nHear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.\n‚Äï Isaiah 48:1 These are the Israelites, God\u0026rsquo;s chosen people, who confess his name, but crucially not in truth or right. They are in fact hypocrites, lacking integrity, lacking honesty, lacking righteousness. And so the Lord refines them in the furnace of affliction. And why? For his own sake and for his own glory. Otherwise how would his name be profaned, dishonoured by these hypocrites professing his name in falsehood?\nBut notice how the Lord restrains his anger at these hypocrites. He holds it back for the sake of his praise and instead he chooses to refine.\nWhat was this furnace of affliction? It was the eighteen month siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar followed by the exile of Judah to Babylon, truly the grimmest of times.¬†Into the fire indeed.\nAnd was that enough? Was that to be the end of the refining? No it was not. Upon their return to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile there is a further prophecy from Zechariah, again of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own chosen people.\nIn the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive. And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‚ÄòThey are my people‚Äô; and they will say, ‚ÄòThe LORD is my God.‚Äô\n‚Äï Zechariah 13:8-9 Two thirds perished and the remaining one third was to be put into the fire by the hand of the Lord. And then what? The Lord will say, ‚ÄòThey are my people‚Äô; and they will say, ‚ÄòThe LORD is my God.‚Äô\nAnd now we must endeavour to understand the two different kinds of refining, one which is not as silver and one which is. This is certainly difficult to understand and it seems to me to be a hard teaching indeed. But we must not shy away from such verses! The commentaries differ and so this must be approached with humility. And yet surely we must wrestle with these hard teachings with both intellectual integrity and reverence.\nWhen silver is refined, the whole of it is purified and all the silver is retained. Dross is removed from throughout and from throughout pure silver is retrieved. Nothing is lost.\nWhat then is a refining not as silver? I believe it may be a separation, as of sheep and goats. Not all are accepted. Some are rejected.\nThe people to whom Isaiah prophesied were to be refined but not as silver. Later, after the return from the exile, two thirds perished. Rejected. Discarded. One third remained to be further refined, and this time as silver.\nOh my soul, cry out to the Lord lest you be refined but not as silver, for both kinds of refining remain. Listen to Jesus.\nWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.\n‚Äï Matthew 25:31-32 O my soul, there is to be such a separation. Pray for mercy.\nAnd he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äô Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?‚Äô And the King will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äô\n‚Äï Matthew 25:33-40 Besides praying for mercy you must be sure to love and care for the least. For as you do to each of these you do to Jesus himself.\nThen he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.‚Äô Then they also will answer, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?‚Äô Then he will answer them, saying, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.‚Äô And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 25:41-46 Jesus\u0026rsquo; warning in the Sermon on the Mount was both urgent and stark.\nNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?‚Äô And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô\n‚Äï Matthew 7:21-23 Cry out to the Lord for mercy, love him with all of your heart, and trust him in everything. And know that just as he leads into the fire, he also leads out.\nFor you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried. You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs; you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.\n‚Äï Psalm 66:10-12 Here we see both into and out of. Truly through the fire and out to a place of abundance. Do not forget the words of Jesus.\nI came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\n‚Äï John 10:10b O my soul, trust the Lord, knowing that if he leads you into the fire he does indeed know what he is doing, and it is for his praise and his glory.

Are you grateful to him with all your heart? It matters that you are!\nOn the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have mercy on us.‚Äù When he saw them he said to them, ‚ÄúGo and show yourselves to the priests.‚Äù And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus\u0026rsquo; feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus answered, ‚ÄúWere not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?‚Äù And he said to him, ‚ÄúRise and go your way; your faith has made you well.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 17:11-19 Ten lepers were healed but only one was sufficiently grateful to return to Jesus, to thank him and to praise God. What did Jesus say to this one alone? ‚ÄúYour faith has made you well.‚Äù Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this leave us wondering, what of the others? Did they remain healed? We don\u0026rsquo;t know and we can\u0026rsquo;t know. I suspect the generosity of the Lord towards ungrateful sinners is that they did in fact remain healed. But really, shame on them!\nI will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.\n‚Äï Psalm 9:1-2 So is this what gratitude must be? Ensuring to thank the Lord with your whole heart as and when you receive blessing and healing and deliverance, with the expectation of further blessing to come? By no means! O my soul, you must not settle for such an impoverished understanding of thankfulness.\nPaul gives us a clue.\nGive thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 5:18 In all circumstances you must give thanks, even acknowledging that some of these circumstances are hard to bear. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\nConsider David, fleeing for his life from Saul. Listen to his words.\nBe merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.\nMy soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts‚∏∫the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.\n‚Äï Psalm 57:1, 4 Does this sound remotely like one who is receiving blessing and healing and deliverance? And yet,\nBe exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!\n‚Äï Psalm 57:5 And even in the midst of peril how does he end his psalm?\nI will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!\n‚Äï Psalm 57:9-11 There is something profound here which must be understood, and it is the nature of sacrifice in thanksgiving. Another psalmist articulates it like this.\nI love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.‚ÄØThen I called on the name of the LORD: ‚ÄúO LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 116:1-4 It is in times such as these that it is costly to give thanks, and yet it is precisely because of this that the thanksgiving becomes a sacrifice. The psalmist continues.\nPrecious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 116:15-17 Has he been saved or will his death imminently become precious in the sight of the Lord? It seems somewhat ambiguous to me. Is this why his thanksgiving is a sacrifice? Perhaps he will not even survive the time of crisis and yet still he gives thanks to God. This is the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and it is costly.\nO my soul, I know your heartbreak and your longing. In these you must give thanks. And yes, that is so very painful, but you simply must. Be encouraged by the words of the Apostle Paul.\nDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:6-7 There remain two observations still to be made and it is vital that they be understood.\nThe first is that giving thanks in a situation of pain and grief and heartbreak is not giving thanks for these things, in some kind of passive-aggressive ‚Äúthank you for hurting me‚Äù way. But it is never too difficult to find something truly worthy of thanksgiving.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:3-4 And this surely remains a sacrifice of thanksgiving.\nThe second may seem to be quite close to ‚Äúthank-you for hurting me‚Äù, but in fact it is not. It is the place where joy and sorrow meet and are inextricably intertwined.\nIt is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:7 O sons and daughters dearly loved, know that your Heavenly Father is so deeply invested in you there is nothing he won\u0026rsquo;t do for your eternal good. And some of these things are painful indeed to endure.\nFor the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:11 In the midst of the most painful experience, offer up to God your sacrifice of thanksgiving for such commitment and investment that he has made in you, that he will see through to completion.\nAsaph speaks the word of the Lord to those who may have forgotten this.\nThe one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!\n‚Äï Psalm 50:23 O my soul, offer up to the Lord your sacrifice of thanksgiving however much you are hurting! üôè\n","date":"2024-12-06T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/velizar-ivanov-V_Giq2h5jak-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_761490_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/","title":"The sacrifice of thanksgiving"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you think the spiritual battle sounds exciting?\nWell, it is not. It is mundane and energy sapping and potentially also demoralising and faith destroying. Or not. But which it is, you see, is entirely up to you.\nFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:12 O my soul, you must be wise, for the enemy is cunning and does not show himself. How then does he fight? He fights using broken down cars and cancelled flights and malfunctioning equipment and heavy traffic and spilt drinks. He fights using sickness and frailty and sleeplessness. He fights using bad weather and lost opportunities. He fights using scowling disapproval and the withholding of affirmation. He fights in a myriad of subtle and devious ways.\nHe fights and so you too must fight. And how? One who would fight in the spiritual battle must first understand what is being fought over.\nCount it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.\n‚Äï James 1:2-4 What is being fought over is your very faith. Will you let it wither and die because of your sense of entitlement, that you should somehow escape what others endure? How can faith become anything at all without testing?\nUnderstand that the enemy\u0026rsquo;s goal for you in the spiritual battle is the opposite of steadfastness, that you become uncertain, uncommitted, fluctuating, faltering, and ultimately too discouraged even to want to continue in the walk of faith. And he has such mundane weapons in his arsenal. But,\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God\u0026rsquo;s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith‚∏∫more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire‚∏∫may be found to result in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 1:3-7 Is there not a clear and present danger, that through this testing the things of this world may drag you down or so captivate your heart that you lose your first love?‚∏∫not first chronologically, but first in importance.\nThat same faith is both the means and the end in this spiritual battle. Take up the shield of faith. Believe what Jesus has said and remember what he has done. The disappointments and frustrations and suffering of this world cannot penetrate that shield.\nSurely the psalmist knew this.\nOut of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.\n‚Äï Psalm 8:2 In the spiritual battle deploy that childlike faith which does not seek to understand, but knows how to trust the one whose name is Faithful and True‚∏∫Jesus Christ the righteous one‚∏∫Jesus the lover of my soul.\nI will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, because you have seen my affliction; you have known the distress of my soul, and you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place.\n‚Äï Psalm 31:7-8 As you face these present difficulties, do you think the Lord is somehow ignorant of or indifferent to your affliction? He has seen it, and he has known your distress, O my soul. And he has set your feet in a broad place. In case you have felt trapped by circumstances know that in fact you are free. Because of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s steadfast love and faithfulness, he has set your feet in a broad place.\nHumble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 5:6-10 And listen again to what Jesus said to those Philadelphians, commended without reservation.\nBecause you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth. I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:10-11 O my soul, will you let the mundane troubles and trials of life steal away your peace and security and trust in the Lord? Steal away your faith in a good, wise and kind God of infinite power? Steal away your hope in your future salvation? Steal away the joy of the Lord? By no means!\nO my soul, Jesus is coming soon, so hold fast to faith and hope and love, so that no one may seize your crown! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-29T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-ordinariness-of-the-spiritual-battle/denny-muller-FXrcBTOy8Fw-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1793520_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-ordinariness-of-the-spiritual-battle/","title":"The ordinariness of the spiritual battle"},{"content":"O my soul,\nIf you desire that the Lord light up your eyes, what are you doing about that?\nAre you surprised that I ask what you are doing, as if it could make any difference? Whether the Lord chooses to light up your eyes is entirely out of your hands isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nBy no means!\nListen again to the psalmist.\nThe law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.\n‚Äï Psalm 19:7-11 Start by noticing the pure commandment of the Lord which enlightens the eyes. But we must ingest the whole of it.\nO my soul, do you desire the rules of the Lord? Do you know their sweetness? Do you know that great reward which is keeping them? Do you desire to be revived? Are you feeding and watering that desire that it may flourish, and you with it? Do you even know how?\nThe psalmist is telling it, over and over. The law of the Lord is perfect. The testimony of the Lord is sure. The precepts of the Lord are right. The commandment of the Lord is pure. These revive the soul, make wise the simple, rejoice the heart, and enlighten the eyes.\nSo my question to you is, have you immersed yourself in these and do you continue to do so? Do you begin each new day by plunging into the word of God, his law, his testimony, his precepts, and his commandments? And if not, why not?\nThere is joy here in the face of a demoralising and depressing world. There is power here in the face of the overwhelming and apparently insoluble problems of the world‚∏∫oppression, self-interest, corruption, exploitation, hatred, and war. In such contrast to the world\u0026rsquo;s murkiness and moral ambiguity, the commandment of the Lord is pure and it enlightens the eyes.\nO my soul, steep yourself in the word of God, each morning and throughout the day. Wrap yourself in it and walk in it, with rejoicing and a grateful heart.\nPerhaps you have been waiting for deliverance now for so long you have started to think there is nothing else you can do. O my soul, you must not wallow in your waiting, as if there is nothing to be done. That could not be further from the truth.\nIn your waiting, as days become weeks and weeks become months and with each passing year, are you growing in your desire for the Lord? Are you growing in faith? Are you growing in love and holiness?\nO my soul, this year is so very rapidly approaching its end. Ask yourself, does my heart desire the Lord more so now than at its beginning? Is my faith stronger and more resilient? Have I grown in love and holiness? If not, it has surely been a waste of a year. Do not be so negligent as to waste the next one!\nIn your own longing for change listen to the longing of the psalmist. It is above all a longing for personal holiness.\nBlessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the LORD! Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart, who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways! You have commanded your precepts to be kept diligently. Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes!\n‚Äï Psalm 119:1-5 There is both longing and determination here, and also realism, for doesn\u0026rsquo;t this task seem to be utterly beyond us? But it is not.\nYour testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them. The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple. I open my mouth and pant, because I long for your commandments. Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is your way with those who love your name. Keep steady my steps according to your promise, and let no iniquity get dominion over me.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:129-133 Again, you must be diligent to let no iniquity get dominion over you.\nThere are three more things that remain to be done, and these can be learnt from the Apostle Paul in just half a sentence. The whole sentence is simply too overwhelming to take in at one go, because this is Paul! He has just been describing our glorious inheritance in Christ and the guarantee we have in the Holy Spirit.\nFor this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:15-18a What are these three things?\nThe first is to exercise faith in the Lord Jesus, so it may grow. Are you waiting on an impossible promise from the Lord? Then keep on waiting, believing and not doubting, and he will light up your eyes.\nThe second is to pray. This is Paul\u0026rsquo;s prayer for the saints in Ephesus. Make it your own and not only yours. Pray for the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of the Lord to light up the eyes of your heart, those eyes of faith, which must shine in expectation and reflected glory. And pray this also for others.\nThe third is to love. Do not hold back from loving all the saints. The saints are simply the Lord\u0026rsquo;s people, although some are not yet so very saintly to be sure, being still in the early stages of sanctification and humility. But you must love, and you must not overlook that little word all. If you desire that the Lord light up your eyes, then you must love all the saints.\nDesiring the law of the Lord and his testimonies and his precepts and his commandments and his rules is ultimately an outworking of love itself, our love for the Lord in response to his own great love.\nAre you starting to understand how to put yourself in the place of the Lord lighting up your eyes?\nO my soul, love the Lord and do not hold back! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-22T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/open-your-own-eyes/ben-white-EMZxDosijJ4-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3569367_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/open-your-own-eyes/","title":"Open your own eyes"},{"content":"O my soul,\nAre you discouraged?\nHear the heart-cry of the psalmist and know that you are not alone.\nHow long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?\n‚Äï Psalm 13:1-2 How long must I take counsel in my soul? Discouragement is such a lonely place in which to be‚∏∫after all, who wants to share their discouragement with another? So, lonely but not alone in that loneliness. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the affliction of our age?\nWhat can be done about this? And for how long must it be endured?\nRecall that I wrestled with that second question for Amy. How long O Lord is truly the most unanswered question, although for good reasons. Recall those reasons and hold on to them in your discouragement and dismay for they will help you to endure. But what is endurance without deliverance?\nConsider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:3 Discouragement must be dealt with before it becomes despondency and then depression and then the sleep of death. So what can deliver us from this? Precisely: O LORD my God, light up my eyes.\nLight up my eyes! This is what is needed. O my soul, this is what you need. There is wisdom in the proverb.\nThe light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.\n‚Äï Proverbs 15:30 Jesus explained why this is so vital.\nThe eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n‚Äï Matthew 6:22-23 The eye is the means by which that light enters the body, because this is how we perceive, or choose to perceive, the world around us.\nThere is more than one cause for that light to be lost. Firstly, sin. Do not underestimate the consequences to your spiritual wellbeing of persisting in sin.\nThere is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin. For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness.\nMy heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes‚∏∫it also has gone from me.\n‚Äï Psalm 38:3-5, 10 O my soul, let this not be the cause of your discouragement.\nBut now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n‚Äï Romans 6:22-23 On the other hand, grief could be the cause.\nBe gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief; my soul and my body also. For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing.\n‚Äï Psalm 31:9-10a There are various reasons to grieve but each one is a heartbreaking loss of something or someone. As you grieve know that you are not alone in that. Jesus also grieves and he grieves with you. Recall Martha and Mary\u0026rsquo;s dear brother Lazarus and the sisters\u0026rsquo; bewilderment and dismay that Jesus hadn\u0026rsquo;t saved him, at least at this point in the story.\nNow when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, ‚ÄúLord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.‚Äù When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. And he said, ‚ÄúWhere have you laid him?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúLord, come and see.‚Äù Jesus wept. So the Jews said, ‚ÄúSee how he loved him!‚Äù\n‚Äï John 11:32-36 Jesus wept with Mary, and O my soul, know that he weeps also with you. But even in your grief beware lest sin creep in, as the psalmist continues.\nMy strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away.\n‚Äï Psalm 31:10b In your weakness and vulnerability you must be ever vigilant against sin creeping in. By God\u0026rsquo;s grace and with the power of the Holy Spirit you simply must continue in personal holiness.\nBut irrespective of the cause of discouragement, we must ask what is the source of this light for the eyes, if we are to be encouraged, to be lifted up from our grief, to be freed from sin?\nThe proverb tells more than it knows.\nThe light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.\n‚Äï Proverbs 15:30 What is this good news? It is the ultimate good news, the Gospel of Jesus Christ!\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\n‚Äï John 3:16 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‚ÄúI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:12 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.\nFor to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n‚Äï Isaiah 9:2, 6 And so with this we can finally arrive at the psalmist\u0026rsquo;s destination.\nBut I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:5-6 The Lord has indeed dealt bountifully with each one. Trust in his steadfast love and rejoice in your salvation!\nO my soul, may Jesus himself light up your eyes with grace and truth and love, and may the light of his life shine on you! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-15T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/light-up-my-eyes/imran-ali-HV9dUe3H5z8-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2211372_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/light-up-my-eyes/","title":"Light up my eyes"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you worry that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will may be thwarted by those who have failed to perceive the new thing that he is doing?\nConsider this.\nThus says the LORD,\n‚ÄúRemember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:16a, 18-19 O my soul, are you excited about the new thing that the Lord is doing, because he is indeed doing just that. Are you thirsty for it? The desert is a such a thirsty place but he will make rivers flow there. And he will make a way where there is no way, in this wilderness of unlove. Hallelujah! Hallelujah indeed!\nAnd have you noticed something? Have you noticed the most interesting of timings?‚∏∫those events which have just happened to coincide so as to clear the way for this new thing? This new thing is so heralded, trumpeted by the very angels. And all apparently so very imminent.\nAnd yet at the same time are you not discomfited by the prospect of defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory by those who have not perceived this new thing that the Lord is doing and are standing in the way of it, blocking it from happening, because they are so very busy looking for something else?\nAnd do you somehow see inevitability in this, a tragedy unfolding inexorably? Are you already grieving over that coming defeat even in advance of it being realised? Do you anticipate that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s perfect plans will in fact be thwarted? Are you even now weeping over it?\nWell then stop that. Put aside your sense of impending doom and listen instead to the psalmist.\nLove the LORD, all you his saints! The LORD preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride. Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the LORD!\n‚Äï Psalm 31:23-24 Be strong and let your heart take courage, and pay attention to what the Lord is and is not saying. Did you somehow hear, behold, I am trying to do a new thing if only they would let me? How could you have heard that? Wake up! Wake up and unblock your ears! This is the Almighty Creator God of the Universe. There is no try. Do or not do, that is all. Praise him! And rest in that sure knowledge with peace and confidence.\nNow there\u0026rsquo;s something else here, something interesting. Notice the command to remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Is this about leaving behind our own failure and shame? Well yes of course, it\u0026rsquo;s always about that.\nTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 5:17 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.\n‚Äï Colossians 1:13-14 But here in Isaiah there\u0026rsquo;s something else which is so interesting. Let\u0026rsquo;s hear the whole of it.\nThus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters, who brings forth chariot and horse, army and warrior; they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick: ‚ÄúRemember not the former things, nor consider the things of old.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:16-18 These particular former things are the Lord\u0026rsquo;s parting of the Red Sea so the Israelites could pass safely and escape from their oppressors.\nThus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.\n‚Äï Exodus 14:30-31 So here are past events of miraculous deliverance by the Lord. But do not dwell on these‚∏∫the Lord will not part the waters again. Do not long for the miracle of yesterday for it is no longer needed. In our own time we need an entirely new miracle and it is this that the Lord will do, a new thing.\nAnd some will not perceive this new thing. Jesus said as much.\nAnd no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.\nAnd no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‚ÄòThe old is good.‚Äô\n‚Äï Luke 5:37-39 The Lord is doing a new thing and yet still some will say the old is good. Expect this.\nAnd in your not remembering, take care to remember. We must not expect a repeat of yesterday\u0026rsquo;s miracle, but we must remember the person and character of God. Hear the Lord speaking through Isaiah again.\nRemember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,‚Äô calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:8-11 Remember not but remember. Only three chapters later, is Isaiah contradicting himself? By no means!\nO my soul, you simply must remember who God is and what he has done. Marvel at the intricacy of his plans and purposes, the multiple and concurrent factors at play: a bird of prey from the east, a man of his counsel from a far country. And he will do it. What he has purposed he will do.\nBut do not expect him merely to do what he did before. Today he is doing a new thing because today almost everything is different. Almost.\nRemember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors.\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:8 Those who went before us were wretched sinners and so are we. May we never forget that. And may we never forget how the Lord deals with such.\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 1:15a O my soul, rejoice that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, rest confidently in his sufficiency, marvel at the intricacy of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s perfect plans and purposes, this new thing that he is already doing, and praise him with your whole heart! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-08T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/a-new-thing/tangerine-newt-TN09yTRftZ8-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3218751_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/a-new-thing/","title":"A new thing"},{"content":"O my soul,\nIs that righteous anger we examined last week the right response to all the sin in the world, that sin which corrupts and stains everything, that sin which we see all around us?\nBy no means!\nJesus came to the temple on another occasion, and this visit was so very different.\nEarly in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, ‚ÄúTeacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:2-5 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this woman epitomise all that\u0026rsquo;s wrong with society? Everyone choosing to do what they want with no regard for God\u0026rsquo;s holy law, and no regard for the cost in human suffering and shame? Surely that righteous anger is the fitting response to such a thing, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you say?\nThe Pharisees were clearly angry, but let\u0026rsquo;s pause for a moment and look into the reason for their anger.\nThis they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him.\n‚Äï John 8:6a In truth they didn\u0026rsquo;t really care about honouring the Lord, and they certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the woman herself‚∏∫she evidently meant nothing to them. They were out to test Jesus, to bring a charge against him, to bring him down. Perhaps they saw him as soft on sin, or at least soft on sinners. Their aim was to trap him into contradicting the law so that they could discredit him. Is this not precisely the behaviour of vain and dishonest men of rank? Theirs was so clearly not a righteous anger then.\nAnd what of Jesus\u0026rsquo; righteous anger that we saw previously?\nJesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, ‚ÄúLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.‚Äù And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus stood up and said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNo one, Lord.‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúNeither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:6b-11 Upon being confronted with their own sinfulness, and beginning with the older ones, they went away one by one.\nBeginning with the older ones. Perhaps only eventually do each of us understand how far we fall short. Is there not sometimes a harshness to be seen among the younger generation in their zealous pursuit of what is right and true? Perhaps only with the passage of time and the humble recognition of ongoing failure and shame in our own lives is each of us able to say with Paul,\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 1:15b Let\u0026rsquo;s put aside then that righteous anger that Jesus would have been feeling towards those vain and dishonest men of rank, and ask, what was he feeling towards the adulterous woman?‚∏∫for the answer to that addresses our opening question on how we should respond to all that sin and brokenness we see in the world, that sin which corrupts all. Notice what he said.\nJesus stood up and said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNo one, Lord.‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúNeither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:10-11 Jesus did not condemn and he does not condemn, but it matters that each one sin no more. O my soul, from now on sin no more. Your Saviour demands it! And listen to Jesus explain why he came.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.\n‚Äï John 3:16-17 And so the answer is compassion, not anger.\nThe Father\u0026rsquo;s compassion for our broken and dysfunctional world and our own brokenness was the reason for sending his only Son to rescue and redeem, to die at Calvary where that great love was poured out for all, and to rise again in resurrection victory and power over sin and death and all that corrupts and spoils.\nWe do need to pause however and ask whether the Pharisees had a point. In all his compassion, is Jesus in fact soft on sin? And if his sacrifice at Calvary was sufficient to pay the debt of eight billion sinners, why would we any longer be concerned about the sin that remains. Cannot all be forgiven?\nO my soul, do not so quickly forget Jesus\u0026rsquo; final words to the adulterous woman.\nGo, and from now on sin no more.\n‚Äï John 8:11b What else did Jesus have to say about this?\nWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, ‚Äòwhere their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.‚Äô\n‚Äï Mark 9:42-48 Are these the words of one who is soft on sin? O my soul, you must purge the sin from your own life, and you must be ruthless in this. Do not tolerate it any longer. Do not be deceived‚∏∫look ahead to what will happen at the end of this present age.\nThen I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.\n‚Äï Revelation 20:11-12 Tremble at these things, and be grateful for the book of life, written at such great cost by the author of life. Such is compassion.\nSo thank and praise the Lord for his compassion which rescues and redeems. Put aside your righteous anger before it becomes self-righteousness, soften your heart, and reach out with compassion and kindness and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great rescue for this broken world.\nO my soul, learn to live with humility as one who was once lost and is now saved, put aside that anger, and put on a grateful and compassionate heart! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-01T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/do-not-be-angry/cas-holmes-_zyt1WWWdv4-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2601689_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/do-not-be-angry/","title":"Do not be angry"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat do you make of this?\nBe angry, and do not sin;\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4a Be angry. Why? It is commanded! And in that, do not sin. How? How can this be done? We\u0026rsquo;ll need to give some serious thought to this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by considering the new life that is in Christ. Paul sets the context.\nIf then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:1-4 Let\u0026rsquo;s not progress past this too quickly‚∏∫it is heady truth indeed! I have died and my life is hidden with Christ in God. My eternal being is secure and unassailable. Indeed my very life is Christ. Praise the Lord!\nAnd what then? Paul continues in typical fashion with a therefore.\nPut to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:5-8 None of these have any place in the new life, and of these things that must be put away, did you notice that anger appeared first in the list? But still,\nBe angry, and do not sin;\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4a We may conclude that there are two different kinds of anger. And indeed the words are different.\nFor the anger which must be put aside, having no place in the new life in Christ, Paul uses the Greek word orgƒì, which is an anger full of emotion, violent passion in fact. This is the anger of not getting one\u0026rsquo;s own way. It is the anger of a bruised ego. And the word used for wrath means rage or passion. It is selfish, even childish in its inability to show restraint. Those must be put aside.\nThe psalmist wrote in Hebrew, which precludes direct comparison, but Paul also writes of the anger of the psalmist.\nBe angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:26 Here he uses the Greek word parorgismos, which means indignation or wrath or exasperation. This is not rage. This is a righteous anger.\nSo, the command is to be angry with that righteous anger, with indignation at what ought not to be. But what is that? What should be the object of such anger? To answer that let\u0026rsquo;s consider what was the object of Jesus\u0026rsquo; anger‚∏∫for from time to time he was indeed angry.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one example.\nAnd they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, ‚ÄúIs it not written, ‚ÄòMy house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?‚Äô But you have made it a den of robbers.‚Äù And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.\n‚Äï Mark 11:15-18 Those who were the subject of his anger were very much on the inside of the religious establishment of the day, but their behaviour was brazen in its dishonouring of the Lord. Worthy of anger, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you agree?\nThe way each gospel writer orders their account is interesting and surely rich in meaning. There\u0026rsquo;s just such a juxtaposition here which must be noticed, for this account of Jesus clearing the temple is immediately followed by this.\nAs they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, ‚ÄúRabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 11:20-21 O my soul, do you recall how I grappled previously with this hard teaching of the poor little fig tree being cursed for failing to bear figs out of season?\nJesus\u0026rsquo; anger with that fig tree paralleled his anger with the Pharisees‚∏∫those heinously prideful ones who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom but were not.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s return to our psalm and observe the context out of which it is written.\nAnswer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!\n‚Äï Psalm 4:1 Considering the psalm as a whole we see a man earnestly desiring to live a right life before the Lord while being so very aware of his dependence upon the Lord for that. O my soul, do you know this humble passion for personal holiness combined with complete dependence on Christ for his righteousness? I know that you do!\nThe psalmist has been in distress previously, and is again, and why is that?\nO men, how long shall my honour be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?\n‚Äï Psalm 4:2 The psalmist is despised and rejected by vain and dishonest men. And who are they? Their description is nuanced, literally sons of men. The ESV alternative translation renders it men of rank. So, privileged ones. Exalted ones. Vain and dishonest. Pharisees.\nBe angry, O my soul, you must be angry at that which ought not to be, that which so dishonours the Lord, that pride and hypocrisy. And do not sin.\nSo how are we not to sin in this? There are two ways. The psalmist tells us the first right away.\nBe angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4-5 O my soul, in your own righteous anger know that you are not called to table-flipping and temple-clearing. That is Jesus\u0026rsquo; work. Ponder on your bed and be silent. Put your trust in the Lord. Do you think he hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen this heinous behaviour? Do you think he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know? Do you think he won\u0026rsquo;t respond?\nAnd Paul tells us the second.\nBe angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:26-27 Do you see? Do not let the sun go down on your anger. Do not hold on to it. You must lay it down and let it go.\nBeloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, ‚ÄúVengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 12:19 And where does that leave the psalmist? Blessed and at peace.\nYou have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound. In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:7-8 O my soul, be angry and do not sin! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-25T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/todd-trapani-91T-rq-pY28-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1764464_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/","title":"Be angry"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is the most truly overwhelming outworking of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s discover that in the psalmist\u0026rsquo;s song of praise.\nPraise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for he is beautiful, and a song of praise is fitting. The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names. Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure. The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:1-6 Recall as I explained to Amy that he is beautiful, the alternative translation given in the ESV is the correct one, the reason why it is good to praise the Lord, why a song of praise is fitting. Just pause and rejoice in that for a moment. Praise the Lord, for he is beautiful! Yes indeed he is, in every way!\nAs we praise the infinitely powerful Creator God of the Universe, let\u0026rsquo;s consider for a moment that cosmic power which is his to deploy.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a very real danger of feeling overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the universe he has created. Here in our psalm we read that he determines the number of the stars and he gives to all of them their names. In the creation account we read similarly.\nAnd God made the two great lights‚∏∫the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night‚∏∫and the stars.\n‚Äï Genesis 1:16 He made the sun and the moon, and by the way, he also made the stars.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something of a by-the-way about the stars in our psalm too. Notice the order in which various praiseworthy attributes are listed.\nHe builds up the city of his people; he gathers the outcasts; he binds up the brokenhearted; oh, and by the way, he also determines the number of the stars.\nO my soul, can you see the remarkable truth here? Let\u0026rsquo;s not be so dazzled by the enormity of the physical universe that we lose sight of what is really on the Lord\u0026rsquo;s heart‚∏∫his beloved ones, and especially among them, the brokenhearted, whom he so tenderly and with great compassion binds up and does his miraculous work of healing.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s instead be overwhelmed by this then, that the Lord has set his love on undeserving sinners, and especially on the outcast and the downtrodden and the brokenhearted. And furthermore that he works in them and for them with that very same cosmic power‚∏∫a work of rescue and healing and liberation from the bonds of sin and lifting up of the humble.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s remind ourselves of that passage in Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy from which Jesus read at the beginning of his earthly ministry, for we see there a similar priority.\nAnd he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\n‚Äï Luke 4:16-17 Reading directly from Isaiah, as Jesus did:\nThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s favour, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion‚∏∫to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.\n‚Äï Isaiah 61:1-3 And continuing in Luke\u0026rsquo;s gospel,\nAnd he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 4:20-21 Again, let\u0026rsquo;s be overwhelmed that the Creator God of the Universe cares quite so much about his beloved ones, his brokenhearted ones and those that are oppressed, that he sent his only son, Jesus. This was Jesus\u0026rsquo; mission, and it remains so‚∏∫to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s favour, and to comfort all who mourn.\nO my soul, do you mourn? Know that the Lord is making beauty from the ashes of your own life. Receive his wonderful comfort and be clothed in his garment of praise.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one more thing to notice here. These oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord‚∏∫did you notice who they are? They are in fact these very rescued ones, these liberated captives, these ones with a faint spirit. How is it possible that the bruised and broken and downtrodden become mighty oaks of righteousness in the Kingdom? It is simply because of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power in restoration and transforming grace‚∏∫his cosmic power. And we are even told why, that is, why the Lord does this work of rescue and transformation and planting. It is so that he may be glorified. Praise and magnify his holy name!\nThe Lord is glorified when his character is revealed and made known to the nations‚∏∫his character which is forgiveness and rescue and steadfast love and faithfulness, as he declared to Moses.\nThe LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:5-7 It turns out that making the stars was indeed very much of a by-the-way!\nO my soul, rest in the arms of your Heavenly Father who binds up the brokenhearted, and receive his rescue and healing and transforming grace! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2024-10-18T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/cosmic-power/42916480792-cd4b5fcfdf-o_huff7b18306ec83afc2f073a03ef20a667_4202873_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/cosmic-power/","title":"Cosmic power"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow does a church completely and comprehensively lose its way?\nAnd to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‚ÄòThe words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God\u0026rsquo;s creation.\n‚ÄòI know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 3:14-17 O my soul, grieve with Jesus over this self-satisfied and delusional church. And grieve further over their complete and unmitigated failure and shame. Recall that even in that dead church in Sardis there were some who had not soiled their garments, who being worthy would walk with Jesus in white. In Laodicea no such are mentioned.\nHow could there have been such a gulf between how Jesus saw the church and how they saw themselves? Laodicea was a wealthy city and we may deduce that its church also was affluent and middle-class, seeing itself as rich in every way, lacking nothing. But how self-satisfied they were!\nThey thought they were rich, but they had failed to understand the currency of eternity. In reality they were paupers. And if they saw themselves as discerning, in reality they were blind.\nLaodicea was entirely deception and delusion, but Jesus knew, and he knew they were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. How had this happened? How does this happen to any church which seems to be richly blessed, which maybe even gives the appearance of delighting in the Lord? Perhaps they had simply made their lives all about themselves.\nIsaiah prophecies against just such. Note well the nature of the offence.\nCry aloud; do not hold back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:1-2 See how the house of Jacob delighted to draw near to God. Everything was simply magnificent, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nNo. No it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. O my soul, be appalled at their pride and listen to their self-justification.\nWhy have we fasted, and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:3a The Lord thought otherwise.\nBehold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:3b Notice how they were rebuked for their self-interest and lack of concern for others, and be dismayed with quite how much this contradicted what the Lord required.\nIs not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:6-7 What did Jesus say later?\nA new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\n‚Äï John 13:34-35 Do you see? Loving one another is the barometer of discipleship.\nAnd humility? In their pride and self-satisfaction, how many Laodiceans would have been able to identify with Paul in saying,\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 1:15b I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure the answer would have been none. Certainly none are mentioned by Jesus in his letter. In all six of the other churches, Jesus found at least something to commend‚∏∫even in Sardis. But here, nothing.\nO my soul, wake up to this reality! Jesus\u0026rsquo; warning is as urgent as it is vital.\nNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?‚Äô And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô\n‚Äï Matthew 7:21-23 Now recall that those Philadelphians, with such little power, were commended by Jesus without reservation. Do we see in Laodicea a church condemned without reservation? No we don\u0026rsquo;t‚∏∫at least not that terrible and final condemnation.\nO my soul, marvel over the grace and generosity in Jesus\u0026rsquo; lavish invitation to this prideful and delusional church.\nI counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:18-19 Jesus had not given up on this smug and self-satisfied church, and neither must you. They were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked, and yet look what Jesus was offering. Was it not exactly what they needed? What they really needed? And all they had to do to receive these things was to repent.\nQuite unlike that open door in Philadelphia, the Laodiceans had firmly closed their own door. But listen again to Jesus.\nBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:20 This is Jesus\u0026rsquo; urgent invitation to prideful ones who have completely and comprehensively lost their way. Astonishingly, final condemnation is held back, and what is offered in its place is an invitation to repent.\nMarvel at this.\nThe one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:21-22 O my soul, listen to what Jesus is saying, repent of self-interest and self-satisfaction, humble yourself, and reach out with love for others! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-11T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/self-satisfied-and-delusional/nick-fewings-XpG9JaN_SXQ-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3622405_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/self-satisfied-and-delusional/","title":"Self-satisfied and delusional"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow does an open door constitute a reward?\nAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‚ÄòThe words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.\n‚ÄòI know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 3:7-8a Among the seven churches only Smyrna was able to join with Philadelphia in being commended by Jesus without reservation. Jesus knew their works. What a joy it must have been for him to commend their faithfulness and to richly reward them. So let\u0026rsquo;s consider the reward of that open door. And let\u0026rsquo;s start by asking, how does that even constitute a reward?\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t an open door simply an opportunity presenting itself? Indeed Paul uses exactly this metaphor on several occasions. Here are two examples.\nBut I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 16:8-9 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison‚∏∫that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.\n‚Äï Colossians 4:2-4 Truly the opportunity here was not presenting itself but rather was being presented as a sovereign work of the Lord. Paul was most concerned about the open door for declaring the mystery of Christ, that he may make it clear‚∏∫of course he was. But I am not persuaded that this was the nature of the reward for the Philadelphians.\nPerhaps there\u0026rsquo;s a clue in Jesus\u0026rsquo; next letter.\nBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:20 Jesus is not knocking on the Philadelphian door because it is already open and he is right there among them. This is the door to heaven itself, just as John\u0026rsquo;s vision continues.\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‚ÄúCome up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.‚Äù At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.\n‚Äï Revelation 4:1-3 What a door this is! And it is wide open and cannot be shut. What a reward!\nIn passing we must enjoy to notice John\u0026rsquo;s ludicrous attempt to describe the indescribable, the one seated on the throne. He who was seated there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. Really? Is that the best he could have done? It tells us nothing. Except of course of the ineffability of the Creator God of the Universe, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. Praise his holy name! And praise his indescribable being!\nBefore we continue to think about that door, let\u0026rsquo;s consider what was being rewarded, for it seems to be so very little.\nI know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.\nBecause you have kept my word about patient endurance \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Revelation 3:8b, 10a And that\u0026rsquo;s the entirety of it! But make no mistake, this is not so very little at all. We need to understand what this means, to keep Jesus\u0026rsquo; word and not to deny his name. It is in fact about absolute trust and complete surrender and living an uncompromised life which is fully consistent and perfectly aligned with Jesus being Lord of all. And it is about that personal holiness which is an ongoing act of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; name is his character. It is who he is. So what would deny his name? Would it not be anxiety or doubt or inconsistency or pretence or pride or holding anything back?\nO my soul, do you understand the magnitude of what was being commended? Marvel at it, and now go and do likewise! And if you think you simply lack the strength to live like this, observe that the Philadelphians also had but little power. The power to live like this is all the Lord\u0026rsquo;s and it is his gift of grace. Praise him!\nBut back to this open door. Jesus tells us a bit more about it.\nSo Jesus again said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\n‚Äï John 10:7-10 Jesus is the door, and he is the door to life itself. Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. O my soul, are you starting to understand the magnitude of the Philadelphian reward?\nAnd there is something else which must not be overlooked. What does Jesus say of those who have not lived this pure and holy and surrendered life?\n\u0026hellip; and they will learn that I have loved you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:9b O my soul, have you learnt this? Have you learnt that the King of the Universe has loved you with an everlasting love?\nAnd finally, do not overlook that the abundant life is this life!\nNow to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.\n‚Äï Ephesians 3:20-21 O my soul, live like those Philadelphians, and receive from Jesus the reward of that open door! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-04T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/chris-meads-VDHn0YmjIw4-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_5391919_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/","title":"The open door"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is reputed to be alive but is in fact dead?\nOne answer of course is the church in Sardis.\nAnd to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.\n‚ÄòI know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 3:1 (But we would be fools to think this is the only answer.)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what we can understand about Jesus\u0026rsquo; diagnosis of this dead church. Firstly and quite surprisingly, given the severity of the indictment, doesn\u0026rsquo;t his judgment seem to be rather non-specific?\nHere it is in its entirety.\nWake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:2-3 What has been going on here?\nThere are works but they are not complete. What was received and heard has been forgotten. Repentance is required. And they are asleep. Jesus\u0026rsquo; verdict is that the net effect of these apparently innocuous elements is that the church is dead. Dead, no less!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see if we can understand how that could be.\nThe word used to describe those works which were not complete is the Greek verb plƒìro≈ç, which mostly gets translated fulfilled or fulfil. Their works were not fulfilled. So we should ask, what would be works that were fulfilled? Paul tells us, using the parallel Greek noun plƒìr≈çma.\nLove is the fulfilling of the law.\n‚Äï Romans 13:10b Perhaps there was a deficit of love in Sardis.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s consider what could have been received and heard and subsequently forgotten.\nMore than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.\n‚Äï Romans 5:11 For if, because of one man\u0026rsquo;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.\n‚Äï Romans 5:17 For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 8:15 What had been received was reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters, by whom we cry, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù\nO my soul, grieve with Jesus that this could have been forgotten. How could this be? What could possibly happen that such things be forgotten? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. What happens is that pride enters the human heart, and self-satisfaction displaces gratitude such that one\u0026rsquo;s own status as one who has been rescued is no longer foremost in the mind. It is pride and self-satisfaction that kill humble gratitude and love.\nSo if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:1-3 Just as in the church in Thyatira so too in Sardis there was a call to repent. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it complacency which deafens ears to such a call?\nAnd Jesus urges them to wake up lest he come like a thief in the night, unexpected and frankly unwelcome. Does this not remind us of Jesus\u0026rsquo; warning to his own disciples, concerning his return in glory?\n‚ÄúBut concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. Therefore stay awake‚∏∫for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning‚∏∫lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 13:32-37 O my soul, stay awake!\nAnd tremble also because of Jesus\u0026rsquo; words to the church in Sardis.\nIf you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:3b Against you! Against the ones who had received reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters. These ones who were now found by Jesus to be on the other side.\nO my soul, was there ever such complacency? But wake up. It is in fact all around us. All. Around. Us.\nBut despite this we must notice something vital. While it may have been endemic, this spirit of complacency had not vanquished all.\nYet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:4 O my soul, do not despair. There was a faithful remnant, even here.\nSo what is to be done? Two things.\nFirstly, be appalled at those who have soiled their garments. Those complacent ones. Those who have a reputation of being alive but are in fact dead.\nSecondly, put aside your own complacency and smug self-satisfaction, choose the path of humility, and walk with Jesus in white. And you must be careful to understand what that means.\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, ‚ÄúSalvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!‚Äù\nThen one of the elders addressed me, saying, ‚ÄúWho are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?‚Äù I said to him, ‚ÄúSir, you know.‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúThese are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\n‚Äï Revelation 7:9-10, 13-14 There is no other way to walk with Jesus in white other than by being washed in the blood of the Lamb, other than by receiving reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters. And holding on to these with humble gratitude! O my soul, hold on to these precious gifts.\nBut God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ‚∏∫by grace you have been saved‚∏∫and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:4-9 So walk with a grateful heart in humility, as one rescued, as one whose life now belongs to another. For it is so.\nO my soul, wash your robes in the blood of the Lamb and walk worthy! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-27T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/fooled-by-our-own-reputation/julio-rionaldo-CmuCyTRBDGg-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_842827_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/fooled-by-our-own-reputation/","title":"Fooled by our own reputation"},{"content":"O my soul,\nCan you hear Jesus\u0026rsquo; urgent call to repent?\nThis call to repent went out long ago to the church in Thyatira and it remains today. But let\u0026rsquo;s first marvel at Jesus\u0026rsquo; generous assessment of that church.\nAnd to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: ‚ÄòThe words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze.\n‚ÄòI know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 2:18-19 Among the church in Thyatira were these commended by Jesus for their love and faith and service and patient endurance. O my soul, how are your own love and faith and service and patient endurance? Jesus knows! His eyes are like a flame of fire and nothing is hidden from him.\nAnd did you notice the generosity in his assessment? Their latter works exceeded the first‚∏∫some were slow starters. Jesus did not dwell on what came before. He commended them for how they were now. O my soul, leave the past behind! Jesus does not dwell on what came before and nor must you. Know that he is generous in his assessment also of you, desiring for you only what is good. He loves you and is committed to you and demands reciprocity in these. Rejoice that it is so!\nBut it was not all good news in Thyatira.\nBut I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:20-21 Before we come specifically to the seduction and the sexual immorality, let\u0026rsquo;s notice something significant here‚∏∫a similarity and a difference with what we read in Jesus\u0026rsquo; letter to the church in Ephesus. Here we have a woman calling herself a prophetess and leading the church astray. In the church in Ephesus there were false apostles also leading the church astray. If that is the similarity what is the difference? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it that she was given time to repent and they were not? Recall that there was no call to repentance for those false apostles in Ephesus. They were simply excluded by Jesus and rejected. Tremble at that judgment and that rejection.\nNow our instinct may be to characterise Jezebel\u0026rsquo;s sin as utterly heinous, far worse than what was happening in Ephesus, but pause to consider that Jesus did in fact give her that time to repent. This is not something we can understand in its entirety but surely warns us off ranking sins and ranking sinners.\nAnd what of those she was leading astray?\nBehold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:22-23a Repent! O my soul, notice the urgency to repent. Jesus came to break the chains of bondage to sin and death and to give life in all its abundance, and repentance and faith are the means to receive this precious and lavish gift. But her children, her spiritual offspring who refuse this gift will be struck dead.\nAnd what is this death? Is it not that final, second death?\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:11 And what then of the specifics of the sin‚∏∫sexual immorality and eating of food sacrificed to idols. Of the former we can say one thing immediately.\nDo you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!\nFlee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 6:15, 18-20 How different this is from how our own world views such things. Sexual immorality deeply grieves the Lord, for it is a corruption and a debasement of his wonderful gift to those he made in his own image.\nBut there is something wider going on here. The pagan worship of the day was centred around ritual sexual acts with temple prostitutes and eating of food sacrificed to idols, and this had come in to the church. How this dishonoured the Lord! It was the worldliness of the day invading his church.\nAnd what of worldliness invading the church in our own time? How this dishonours the Lord! And lest you be thinking that what was being rebuked in Thyatira was merely outward behaviour, think again.\nAnd all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:23b Jesus is the one who searches mind and heart. Mind and heart are where the Lord is first honoured or dishonoured. As Jesus said,\nWhat comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\n‚Äï Mark 7:20-23 So what must you repent of? O my soul, do not brush this question aside in complacency. Jesus searches mind and heart, and so must you.\nKeep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.\n‚Äï Proverbs 4:23 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 And hear again Jesus\u0026rsquo; own voice.\n‚ÄúJust so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 15:10 O my soul, repent, leave the past behind, and bring joy before the angels of God! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-20T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/repent/cj-botha-PTztNC4yKY0-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_4204283_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/repent/","title":"Repent!"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow is it that the smallest things are in fact the most important?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s notice something in Jesus\u0026rsquo; letter to the church in Pergamum.\n‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.\n‚Äú‚ÄòI know where you dwell, where Satan\u0026rsquo;s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:12-13 The city of Pergamum was dominated by worship of pagan deities and so the church there was right in the thick of the spiritual battle. But doesn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus\u0026rsquo; commendation seem to be of such a small thing? Simply holding fast his name? Is that all?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not underestimate what such apparently small things are ultimately all about.\nIn the context of forgiving a brother in Christ who has caused much pain, Paul writes this.\nFor this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 2:9 O my soul, are you obedient in everything? Even in apparently small things? Let\u0026rsquo;s consider just one such. Recall something Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.\n‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 5:27-28 Is this not an area which requires honest self-evaluation and ruthless self-discipline? And isn\u0026rsquo;t this precisely one of these apparently small things?\nConsider. As you drive through the student quarter on a balmy summer afternoon, are you noticing the oh-so-attractive and rather scantily clad students parading themselves? And what do your eyes do then? And where do your thoughts take you?\nDo you think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what your eyes are doing, because no-one sees? And where your thoughts are taking you, because no-one knows? It matters! Our Heavenly Father sees and our Heavenly Father knows. The choice between looking to the left or looking to the right is in fact the choice between disobedience and disrespect, or personal holiness and an act of worship. An act of worship to the one who loves you. The one who rescued you. The one who grieves over the vestigial sin in your life. O my soul, choose to honour him in this! Make every small victory over sin an act of worship, and keep your eyes to the right!\nIn the contexts of giving and praying and fasting, Jesus follows up with this.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:4, 6, 18 David knew this.\n‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought.\n‚Äï 1 Chronicles 28:9a Every plan. Every thought. And the intent behind each and every thought. Every motive which wanted to remain hidden is in fact fully exposed to the Lord who searches all hearts.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nDo you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?\n‚Äï Romans 6:16 Holding fast Jesus\u0026rsquo; name is in truth all about consistency and integrity in the secret heart. Do you realise your character is the product of a thousand seemingly insignificant choices? You simply cannot do one thing and become another.\nIf then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\nAnd whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:1-4, 17 O my soul, you must also take heed of Jesus\u0026rsquo; sharp two-edged sword.\nFor the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.\n‚Äï Hebrews 4:12-13 Finally, notice that Antipas chose martyrdom rather than deny Jesus. And his reward? To bear the same description as of Jesus himself!\nGrace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.\n‚Äï Revelation 1:4-5 Jesus is the faithful witness and he bestowed upon Antipas the very same title.\nO my soul, be ruthlessly consistent in how you approach all these apparently small things, and be Jesus\u0026rsquo; faithful witness in everything! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-10T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/small-victories/robert-collins-tvc5imO5pXk-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3471013_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/small-victories/","title":"Small victories?"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you love your life?\nMany do. But what does Jesus expect and require?\n‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‚ÄòThe words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.\n‚Äú‚ÄòI know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:8-9 Only two out of the seven churches are commended without rebuke, and Smyrna is one. Let\u0026rsquo;s first notice how much the currency of heaven differs from that of the world. These faithful ones in Smyrna were suffering and impoverished and slandered, and yet regarded by Jesus as rich. Rejoice that the currency of heaven is not that of the world!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also notice that they were slandered by those falsely claiming to be Jews. Slander is speech which is injurious to another\u0026rsquo;s good name. Jesus stands with and commends these slandered ones. And their accusers? A synagogue of Satan! Can you imagine a clearer or harsher or more final judgment? As in Ephesus, those seeming to hold and wield power were utterly rejected by him.\nWhat could these faithful ones in Smyrna expect to receive for their patient endurance?\n‚ÄòDo not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 2:10 Suffering. Prison. Even greater tribulation. And for some, death.\nAnd this is a test! This time the test is not to endure years of waiting. This is a crisis time distilled into ten days, but let us not underestimate the severity of such testing.\nThe writer to the Hebrews tells us what was similarly faced by others so highly commended for their faith.\nSome were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword.\n‚Äï Hebrews 11:35-37 Is this the reward for faithfulness and patient endurance? By no means! The actual reward is clearly stated.\n‚ÄúBe faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:10b O my soul, have you noticed that for each of the letters to the seven churches, Jesus introduces himself differently, and for each so pertinently to the situation found there.\n‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‚ÄòThe words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:8 Isn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus reminding those about to face death that that is not the end? Praise him for such grace and kindness and understanding!\nPaul endured hardship and suffering and the prospect of death. What did he have to say?\nYes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,‚ÄØas it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honoured in my body, whether by life or by death.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:18b-20 Here is Paul rejoicing even in the face of the danger of death. And what is he most concerned about? That he will not be ashamed, that his courage will withstand, and that Christ may be honoured in his body, whether by life or by death!\nHow is this possible? He knew about that crown of life.\nFor to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:21-24 There is no death wish here, simply a crystal clear understanding of the joys that lie ahead in the heavenly realms. To die is gain, of course it is. To depart and be with Christ is far better. This must be fully understood! Observe and savour Paul\u0026rsquo;s peace and lightness of spirit, that he is able to quip about choosing as if the choice were his own! And through the prayers of the Philippian Christians and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ he knows that this will turn out for his deliverance.\nO my soul, do not neglect to pray for those facing such trials, that they may know the same, and know too that this is not something worth being anxious about.\nAnd which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?‚Å†\n‚Äï Luke 12:25 And Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honour him.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 12:23-26 This challenges us to the very core of our faith, oh how it does!

And what must remain the most important thing even when confronted by unbearable evil?\nTo answer this let\u0026rsquo;s examine both Jesus\u0026rsquo; commendation and his rebuke of the church in Ephesus.\n‚ÄúTo the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.\n‚Äú‚ÄòI know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name\u0026rsquo;s sake, and you have not grown weary.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:1-3 These are the words of the risen Lord Jesus, who holds the angels of the seven churches in his right hand, who walks among the seven churches, and whose name is Faithful and True. Praise him!\nFirstly let\u0026rsquo;s notice the patient endurance which is so highly commended, and the toil. Enduring patiently is hard work! It is heart work. These Ephesian Christians were enduring patiently and not growing weary. How they must have been fixing their eyes on Jesus!\nTherefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,‚ÄØlooking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.\nConsider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:1-3 O my soul, do you notice an absolutely vital element of patient endurance here? It is personal holiness. Let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely. A life beset by sin saps endurance and loses the race. A holy life endures and wins the race. Choose to live a holy life!\nNow endurance is only so in the face of adversity. So what was the adversity in Ephesus? We are told immediately. There was a clear and present evil, namely those who called themselves apostles and were not.\nWhat can be said about those self-proclaimed and false apostles? They were surely found among the Ephesian church, because otherwise what testing would have been required, and what would these patient and enduring ones have had to bear? These patient ones so highly commended by Jesus? But at the same time, those false apostles did not belong to the church. Strikingly, this letter to the church is not addressed to them. They are third parties, judged by Jesus himself to be inconsequential and irrelevant. There is no call for their repentance. They are simply not part of his church. O my soul, tremble at this complete and comprehensive rejection.\nWe can wonder at the impact they were having on the Ephesian church. It was likely profound. But Jesus\u0026rsquo; focus is on those he calls his own, whom he commends for enduring patiently and bearing up for his name\u0026rsquo;s sake‚∏∫for Jesus\u0026rsquo; name\u0026rsquo;s sake‚∏∫for the sake of all he is and all he has done. This is why they endure.\nAnd quite remarkably, they have not grown weary. O my soul, think on that. How wearisome would be this opposition and yet their strength remains. Praise the Lord for his strengthening under such adversarial circumstances!\nAnd yet these very ones commended for their patient endurance are at the same time rebuked by the Lord. Why is that?\n‚ÄúBut I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.\u0026quot;\n‚Äï Revelation 2:4-5 The rebuke is for lack of love, abandonment even, of the very most important thing.\nAnd one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, ‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe most important is, ‚ÄòHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 12:28-31 There is indeed no other commandment greater than these. Not only does love conquer all, but it must be ahead of all.\nThese who patiently endured had once loved with Jesus\u0026rsquo; own love, but they had fallen away from this. And notice Jesus\u0026rsquo; exhortation that they do the works they did at first. Love is such a practical thing. It is something to be done. Both love for the Lord and love for one another are evidenced by works.\nBe careful here. Some are rather eager to ask, what does that look like? But that is entirely the wrong question. How so? It is vital that this be understood.\nWhat is required is love‚∏∫our own love response to that great Calvary love poured out. Who can say what action might result from that? But one thing is clear. It is the love that counts. The action is merely evidence of that love. Aping this is of little value. Action without love is hollow.\nAnd notice this.\nWhat good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\nBut someone will say, ‚ÄúYou have faith and I have works.‚Äù Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\n‚Äï James 2:14-18 As with faith so with love. It is seen by works but those works cannot substitute for love.\nAnd we must not neglect to notice just how much is at stake here. Here is a wake-up call for those whose love is mediocre.\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:7 The conquering here is relearning to love‚∏∫there was no other rebuke. And we know what this tree of life is.\nThen the LORD God said, ‚ÄúBehold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever‚Äî‚Äù therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.\n‚Äï Genesis 3:22-24 The fruit of the tree of life is well guarded, kept for the one who conquers. O my soul, think about that love you had at first. That great Calvary love, poured out for you. And be that one.\nBy this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.\n‚Äï 1 John 3:16 We love because he first loved us.\n‚Äï 1 John 4:19 O my soul, love again with that love you had at first, that great Calvary love poured out for you!üôè\n","date":"2024-08-27T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/enduring-in-love/mahmoud-sulaiman-aO9nGw9Cbk0-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3395044_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/enduring-in-love/","title":"Enduring in love"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is the hardest thing?\nI mean, what is the hardest thing to endure?

I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n‚ÄúCome, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 3:7-8, 10 Finally Moses was ready to be used by the Lord for this great task. How do we know that?\nBut Moses said to God, ‚ÄúWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 3:11 Moses had become nothing. He had died to self. It had taken forty years, because there had previously been so much pride in his heart. He had previously been so full of Moses, so pleased with himself. And now he regarded himself as nothing at all. But he wasn\u0026rsquo;t. He was finally ready to be used greatly by the Lord. And he was.\nAnd Joseph? After more than ten years in prison, he had to wait yet another seven before the Lord used him to rescue the people of Israel from famine in the land of Canaan. What was his testimony then?\nBefore the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. ‚ÄúFor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúGod has made me forget all my hardship and all my father\u0026rsquo;s house.‚Äù The name of the second he called Ephraim, ‚ÄúFor God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Äï Genesis 41:50-52 O my soul, praise the Lord for his faithfulness to Joseph, and rest in that same faithfulness. He knows precisely what he is doing, and all his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness. He takes the years that are required, and those years are not wasted. Rather they are the time of preparation and meticulous restoration and transforming grace.\nDo you know how a diamond is formed? Under intense pressure and heat and a billion years of waiting. Are those wasted years?\nAnd Jesus? Even as a twelve year old he displayed such understanding. Do you not think he would have wanted to heal the sick and the brokenhearted and rescue the lost when he was seventeen? When he was twenty-three? When he was twenty-eight?\nO my soul, in your own waiting time know that Jesus understands.\nSince then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\n‚Äï Hebrews 4:14-16 What is the greatest temptation in the waiting time? Is it not to doubt the goodness and faithfulness and sufficiency of God? Repent of those doubts and trust the Lord!\nAnd did you notice that question which was asked four times by the psalmist and still not answered? How long O Lord? How long? This is the most unanswered question, and painfully so. But what is the psalmist really asking for?\nConsider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:3 It is not really an answer to his question that the psalmist is seeking. It is the answer which is the presence and compassion and adequacy and rescue of God.\nAnd notice too how this answer is received.\nBut I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:5 O my soul, in your own waiting time you must trust in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s steadfast love. And here is trust. It is to assert and to dwell in the wisdom and kindness and faithfulness and sufficiency of the Lord right in the middle of that painful longing. Right there in the middle of the waiting is the only opportunity to trust. So do that, and rejoice in his salvation!\nAnd what then?\nI will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:6 O my soul, sing to the Lord, because he has already dealt bountifully with you! üôè\n","date":"2024-08-20T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/blessed-in-the-waiting/49820769116_8868b8d012_o_hu5ebaa96a626c1503a358f8fac938b96b_1650343_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/blessed-in-the-waiting/","title":"Blessed in the waiting"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat are those years the locusts have eaten?\nI will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Joel 2:25a Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this sound like a wonderful promise of restoration? But what does it mean? To understand those years we must first understand the locusts. So what are the locusts? I have quoted only half a verse.\nI will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.\n‚Äï Joel 2:25 These are the words of the Lord, and so these are his own locusts, his great army, which he sent.\nThe word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:\nHear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers? Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.\nWhat the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.\n‚Äï Joel 1:1-4 Whatever is going on here clearly was and is of vital importance and must be remembered. Notice the urgent exhortation to pay attention, to tell the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, not to forget even through the generations. We ourselves must not overlook this. It is as relevant today as it was then.\nWe learn more from Zephaniah.\n‚ÄúI will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,‚Äù declares the LORD. ‚ÄúI will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the rubble with the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth,‚Äù declares the LORD.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:2-3 Who are these wicked ones who have brought down such judgment from the Lord?\n‚ÄúI will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem‚Äù\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:4a These are the Lord\u0026rsquo;s chosen people, the hitherto recipients of his covenant love. And this is a prophecy of the day of the Lord, that terrible day of judgment and destruction rained down by the Lord on his own people, his beloved ones.\nBut why? Why would this happen?\n‚ÄúI will punish the officials and the king\u0026rsquo;s sons and all who array themselves in foreign attire.‚Äù\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:8 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s people, his highest and most exalted ones, had become so compromised, so contaminated by the nations. So worldly. So like us in fact.\n‚ÄúAt that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are complacent, those who say in their hearts, ‚ÄòThe LORD will not do good, nor will he do ill.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:12 O my soul, do you think this couldn\u0026rsquo;t happen to us? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that thought the very definition of complacency? That the Lord will not do good, nor will he do ill? That everything will just continue to tick along as we all go about our lives? That the extent of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s interest is merely to observe? O my soul, repudiate such thinking. Purge that complacency.\nWhat then should be done in the face of this day of judgment?\nBe silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:7a Are you so full of bluster? So full of excuses? So full of self-justification? Be silent! Be silent before the Lord God!\nAnd then what?\nSeek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his just commands; seek righteousness; seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the anger of the LORD.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 2:3 We must be silent and humble ourselves and seek righteousness and humility. But where may these be found in the midst of all this negligence and self-indulgence and intransigence?\nJohn tells us of the first.\nMy little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\n‚Äï 1 John 2:1-2 And Paul tells us of the second.\nHave this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:5-8 Seek righteousness and humility. Seek Jesus. Cry out to him for salvation and turn to him so that you may be hidden on that terrible day of the Lord.\nFor you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:3 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:28-29 Let us repent of complacency and brainless triumphalism, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s something else to notice here.\nBe silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:7 The Lord has indeed prepared a sacrifice.\nAnd Isaac said to his father Abraham, ‚ÄúMy father!‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúHere I am, my son.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúBehold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?‚Äù Abraham said, ‚ÄúGod will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 22:7-8 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n‚Äï Hebrews 9:24-26 Not only has the Lord prepared the sacrifice of his only Son at such enormous cost, but through him he has also consecrated his guests. O my soul, your own consecration is ongoing, as you are so very aware. Rejoice that it continues and exult with all your heart at the lavish generosity of this restoration.\nSing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; he has cleared away your enemies.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 3:14-15 And observe how the Lord himself rejoices to see his people returning to him in repentance and humility.\nThe LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 3:17 O my soul, be quieted by that great Calvary love, rejoice and give thanks to the one who restores those years! üôè\n","date":"2024-08-13T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/locusts/Exodus_10_hu9f2b42aac2c7717a325a8f9891a066b0_33298_120x120_fill_q75_h2_box_smart1_2.webp","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/locusts/","title":"Locusts"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is this answer that the psalmist received when he told the Lord of his ways?\nWhen I told of my ways, you answered me; teach me your statutes!\n‚Äï Psalm 119:26 And why is this followed by an immediate and urgent plea to be taught his statutes?\nAnd what even was the question that demanded an answer? Do you see a question here from the psalmist?\nCould it be that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer is not so much an answer to a question but something far deeper?\nWe find something similar in the previous psalm.\nOut of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:5 Calling on the Lord is no sort of question. This is a cry for help. So what is the answer?\nJoel tells of an answer of a similar kind. In the context of the day of the Lord, that fearful day of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s righteous judgment of his own wayward people, that day of destruction, that day of reckoning, we find this.\nThen the LORD became jealous for his land and had pity on his people. The LORD answered and said to his people, ‚ÄúBehold, I am sending to you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.\n‚Äï Joel 2:18-19 There is only one question in sight here, and it is found in the prayer of the ministers of the Lord.\nSpare your people, O LORD, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations.

The Lord is faithful even when his people are not. He never once forgot that covenant promise. He never once forgot that covenant love poured out at Calvary and he never will. He is faithful in covenant love to his people even when they are not. O my soul, praise the God of your salvation!\nAnd what was his answer for his chosen people in the midst of that divine and righteous judgment of the day of the Lord?

Praise the Lord, who has dealt wondrously with us all! And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved!\nAnd this is where we started. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine the context of our opening verse.\nMy soul clings to the dust; give me life according to your word! When I told of my ways, you answered me; teach me your statutes!

Seven.\nMy soul clings to the dust; give me life according to your word! When I told of my ways, you answered me; teach me your statutes! Make me understand the way of your precepts, and I will meditate on your wondrous works. My soul melts away for sorrow; strengthen me according to your word!

We\u0026rsquo;ll come to that.\nBut what is going on here that leads to such a turnaround?\nMy soul melts away for sorrow. Do you know what that is like? To live with such vulnerability in that place right on the edge of crumpling into a heap and sobbing uncontrollably? The place of clinging on when all strength is gone? The place of crying out for life itself?\nThere are some heart-cries here for the Lord to act with compassion and great power: Give me life according to your word! Make me understand the way of your precepts! Strengthen me according to your word! Put false ways far from me! But these in and of themselves are not the turning point. The turning point comes next and it is this.\nI have chosen the way of faithfulness.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:30a This is the turning point. In weakness and in sorrow, clinging on in the dust, with courage and determination the psalmist chooses the way of faithfulness. Everything follows from this. O my soul, choose the way of faithfulness!\nBut what exactly is this way of faithfulness?\nFirstly, let\u0026rsquo;s be clear about whose faithfulness this is. Recall the Lord\u0026rsquo;s introduction of himself to Moses.\nMoses said to the LORD, ‚ÄúSee, you say to me, ‚ÄòBring up this people,‚Äô but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‚ÄòI know you by name, and you have also found favour in my sight.‚Äô Now therefore, if I have found favour in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favour in your sight.‚Äù\nMoses said, ‚ÄúPlease show me your glory.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 33:12-13, 18 The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:5-7 This is the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\nThis way of faithfulness is the way of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness. So what does it mean to choose this way?\nDavid knew.\nVindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Psalm 26:1-3 To choose the way of faithfulness and to walk in it is to trust in the Lord without wavering. It is to rely on him whatever else is happening, reminding oneself of his steadfast love. Prove me, O Lord, and try me. Know that I do not doubt you. I do not doubt your goodness and your mercy.\nO my soul, what do you suppose is this proving? This trying? This testing?\nIt is to see beyond current circumstances with eyes of faith, beyond current suffering, to assert with the psalmist out of the darkest valley, out of the deepest sorrow, out of the most wrenching pain:\nI know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:75 It is to assert confidence in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness and to wait upon him, trusting and not doubting. Beyond the point of understanding, beyond the point of being able to see is where trust is tried, tested, and proven. And in this time of testing, this waiting time, it is to walk in one\u0026rsquo;s integrity, keeping covenant with the Holy One, surrendering all to him as an act of worship, perhaps in tears and bewilderment, but surrendering nonetheless.\nAnd what must one do while walking in this way of faithfulness?\nI set your rules before me.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:30b When your heart is breaking, set his rules before you and walk in them, and know this:\nAll the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.\n‚Äï Psalm 25:10 O my soul, be sure to keep his covenant and his testimonies!\nAnd now what about that future tense of the running?\nI will run in the way of your commandments when you enlarge my heart!\n‚Äï Psalm 119:32 My heart is breaking and I simply lack the capacity for this. How can I endure this waiting time? My strength is almost gone. But the Lord himself enlarges my heart.\nThese sterile and barren bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance. That is why waiting does not diminish us, any more than waiting diminishes a pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the waiting. We, of course, don‚Äôt see what is enlarging us. But the longer we wait, the larger we become, and the more joyful our expectancy.\n‚Äï Romans 8:23-25 MSG I will run, O my soul, I will! I will run in the way of his commandments, trusting and not doubting. I choose the way of faithfulness. I choose to trust the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nO my soul, trust in the Lord with all your heart and choose the way of his steadfast love and faithfulness! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-30T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-turning-point/_hu2592a06bfa7b450531f084cfe1250709_2656986_a1cd222c21e60a940f8c3700b2039fff.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-turning-point/","title":"The turning point"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHave you given much thought to what is pure?\nFinally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:8 What is pure then?\nThe words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.\n‚Äï Psalm 12:6 This psalm underlines the striking contrast between the purity of the Lord and his words and the double-mindedness of humankind.\nEveryone utters lies to his neighbour; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.\n‚Äï Psalm 12:2 The words of the Lord then are pure, but what else? Is the catalogue of what is pure in fact a very short list indeed? Could we add to that list? What else could be pure?\nJesus said:\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n‚Äï Matthew 5:8 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this one beatitude stand out from among the others as utterly intimidating? Being poor in spirit, mourning, meekness, hunger and thirsting for righteousness, being merciful‚∏∫isn\u0026rsquo;t our response to those others, yes Lord? But being pure in heart? Isn\u0026rsquo;t our response to this, O Lord have mercy on me, a sinner? Yes of course it is, at least it is if we have any honesty in our own self-evaluation. And that is because it seems to be utterly beyond us. But is it? Is it really? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this, and as we do, give thought to the prize.\nO my soul, do you want to see God? Then resolve to do this, to be pure in heart. But how? How can we?\nJob\u0026rsquo;s friend Eliphaz uttered much foolishness in his earnest desire to help Job. Here\u0026rsquo;s some of it.\nCan mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?\n‚Äï Job 4:17 He followed up with two rhetorical questions, revealing the limitations of his own understanding.\nWhat is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?\n‚Äï Job 15:14 He was wrong, O my soul. Rejoice that he was wrong.\nThe LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ‚ÄúMy anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.\n‚Äï Job 42:7b Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to answer the question by understanding how. How is it possible to be pure before the Lord? There are three elements which must come together.\nThe first is this.\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 Cleanse means purify. Jesus came and died for you and for me and for all of humankind, that we may be forgiven our sin, that we may be justified and redeemed, and that we may be purified from all unrighteousness. The justification and redemption were an immediate and once-and-for-all-time thing. The purification is a rest-of-our-life thing and is the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. Without the body and blood of Jesus there can be no meaningful purification, so perhaps Eliphaz was not entirely wrong.\nThis is the first and most fundamental element of purification.\nThe psalmist points us to the second.\nHow can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:9-11 I love this. I am that young man, so desiring to keep my way pure and yet so aware of the challenge in that, and so aware of my own propensity to sin‚∏∫so aware of how I fall short, and therefore so resolute in guarding my heart according to the revealed word of God. And seeking him will take my whole heart, but it will be so worth it.\nYou will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD.\n‚Äï Jeremiah 29:13-14a With all my heart I will seek the Lord, ruthlessly and unrelentingly. No holding back. No compromise. No distractions. My heart-cry is, let me not wander from your commandments!\nO my soul, do you understand what it means to store up his word in your heart? Immerse yourself in the Bible. It is his precious gift to us. Read it. Savour it. Chew on it. Digest it. Commit it to memory. And do it. It will guard your heart.\nThis is the second element of purification.\nAnd the third? The third element is surprising and inclined to be overlooked in this regard, but it is in fact the game-changer, the red pill.\nAnd it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:9-11 The third element is the extraordinary power of love, both the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great love which came first, and our love response to his rescue‚∏∫our love for the Lord and our love for one another. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this simply astonishing? That the outworking of authentic and abounding love could be a pure heart? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this.\nThis fruit of righteousness comes through Jesus Christ, and is to the glory and praise of God. It is his own work in us, and it is all of grace.\nFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:8-9 We love because he first loved us.\n‚Äï 1 John 4:19 This is love from a grateful heart. But how can purity be the result of this love? Didn\u0026rsquo;t the Pharisees expend so much energy dotting every i and crossing every t in order to become pure?

Narrowly escaping death at their hands he was sold into slavery at the age of seventeen and then thrown into prison in Egypt for a crime he didn\u0026rsquo;t commit, where he was incarcerated for more than ten years.\nIs this what God had intended for him? Why had this all happened? Is this what the Lord\u0026rsquo;s perfect plans and purposes look like for those he loves?\nBy no means! We simply must account for human folly and foolishness. Joseph\u0026rsquo;s own life and his whole family were dominated by these.\nNow Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colours. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:3-4 Jacob, now called Israel, fathered Joseph in his old age and doted upon him, unwisely favouring him above his brothers whose subsequent envy grew to become hatred.\nAnd Joseph demonstrated that he was his father\u0026rsquo;s son through his own lack of wisdom.\nJoseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father\u0026rsquo;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:2 At seventeen shouldn\u0026rsquo;t he have known better how to get on with his brothers than telling tales about them to their own father?\nNow Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. He said to them, ‚ÄúHear this dream that I have dreamed: Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.‚Äù His brothers said to him, ‚ÄúAre you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?‚Äù So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:5-8 Joseph\u0026rsquo;s dream was from the Lord and revealed a glorious future. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to that. But this revelation caused his brothers to hate him even more. They hated him even more because he was unwise enough to tell them of that prophecy which did indeed come to pass, eventually. Nevertheless, sharing it with his brothers as he did was both foolish and inflammatory. He was his father\u0026rsquo;s son.\nAnd this was a mistake he repeated.\nThen he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, ‚ÄúBehold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 37:9 Perhaps such things are better kept to one\u0026rsquo;s self.\nLater when he arrived in Egypt as a slave he was equally naive. Let\u0026rsquo;s first notice how this foreign slave without credentials or experience became the trusted overseer of the household of Potiphar, the captain of the guard of the Pharaoh of Egypt.\nThe LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master. His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:2-3 Wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blessing from the Lord all entirely undeserved? Grace and favour were raining down from heaven on this naive young man.\nAnd then he was accused by Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife of attempted rape. But notice again the pattern here. Just as Joseph had been unwise to share that dream with his brothers, so also he was unwise to be in the house alone with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife.\nNow Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. And after a time his master\u0026rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, ‚ÄúLie with me.‚Äù But he refused \u0026hellip;\nAnd as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:6-8, 10 And so it continued day after day. His woeful encounter with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife was not an isolated incident.\nAs soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, ‚ÄúThis is the way your servant treated me,‚Äù his anger was kindled. And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king\u0026rsquo;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:19-20 Joseph again got what he deserved for his own foolishness, didn\u0026rsquo;t he? But what do we find, again?\nBut the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:21 The undeserved steadfast love of the Lord continued to rain down upon him.\nAnd whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:23 Eventually‚∏∫and never was a word so appropriate as here in Joseph\u0026rsquo;s life‚∏∫eventually, Joseph came before Pharaoh himself, in a way which was indeed by the hand of the Lord, interpreted his dream, and was freed to a great and glorious future.\nThen Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSince God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.‚Äù And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSee, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 41:39-41 How ironic. Through those long years of incarceration God had transformed that foolish youth into a man so discerning and wise. What a miracle of grace. Praise the Lord!\nO my soul, you know the rest. Famine in Canaan caused Jacob to send his sons to Egypt to buy food. After some scheming by Joseph which we could see as teaching his brothers a lesson (and who could blame him for that?) there was an emotional reconciliation. And then what?\nThus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.\n‚Äï Genesis 47:27 What is this story all about then? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s incredible rescue of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s family from famine in their own land? Yes, certainly it is that. A family reconciliation after separation caused by hatred and betrayal? Yes, that too. Rescue and restoration of a naive young man from the consequences of his own foolishness? Indeed.\nBut ultimately isn\u0026rsquo;t this in fact all about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for undeserving sinners? A Plan B so good and full of grace it seems to improve upon that hypothetical Plan A which never transpired. This Plan B which was wrought out of folly and foolishness and disappointment and shame.\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 So much had gone wrong, but none of this pain and heartbreak and suffering was intended by the Lord nor attributable to him.\nAnd so it is with us. He is the great rescuer, fully able to pick up the pieces of ruined lives and work all things together for good. His plans and purposes are not thwarted by our mistakes nor by our foolishness. Praise the Lord! And throughout Joseph\u0026rsquo;s story never once did God\u0026rsquo;s grace and steadfast love and faithfulness reach its limit. His grace is sufficient. Yes, the rescue took its time, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t it so well worth the wait?\nRejoice, O my soul, in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for your own ruined life! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-09T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/senjuti-kundu-JfolIjRnveY-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1444207_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/","title":"Plan B"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWould you build a dam across the river of living water?

Would you?\nO my soul, know that I do understand why you would want to build your dam. I acknowledge that you have been treated heinously and that you have been brushed aside and disregarded. And I know that you\u0026rsquo;re hurting, really hurting, and from time to time you want to assert that nobody cares. You want to shout it out across the rooftops at the top of your voice: nobody cares. It\u0026rsquo;s a lie, by the way, that nobody cares. For sure, there are some who don\u0026rsquo;t, perhaps several, and others who are only pretending. But there remain those who are loving and kind and faithful and true.

Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‚ÄòOut of his heart will flow rivers of living water.‚Äô‚Äù Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n‚Äï John 7:37-39 O my soul, do you thirst? Do you thirst for love and wholeness and relational authenticity? Come to Jesus and drink. Believe in him and listen to him. Listen to him in your sorrow and pain and dismay.\n‚ÄúBut I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil.

Extend love and kindness to those who do not, and it will be measured back to you, O my soul, how it will! And rivers of living water will flow out of your heart and you will be a blessing to many.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t the way these insolent ones carry on simply egregious? Yes of course it is, and appallingly so. What\u0026rsquo;s to be done then about their heinous behaviour?\nBe angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4-5 Be angry, O my soul. Be angry and do not sin. Notice it is ‚Äúand‚Äù not ‚Äúbut‚Äù. Interesting! The dam on the river is not made of anger. Was Jesus angry when he cleared the temple? Yes of course he was and rightly so. There is a righteous anger and it is of the Lord. Be angry and do not sin. The behaviour is egregious and it cannot be excused. It can only be forgiven, and this you must do.\nAnd listen to the heart-cry of the Psalmist to the Lord. Make it your own as you put your trust in the Lord.\nDeal bountifully with your servant, that I may live and keep your word. Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.\nYou rebuke the insolent, accursed ones, who wander from your commandments. Take away from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:17-18, 21-22 The Lord himself is the one who rebukes these insolent ones. And there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nThe word of the LORD came to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.\nThus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:1-3,10 And there is good news indeed for these poor sheep.\nI myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:15-16 But beware, O my soul, there is a warning also to these very same sheep.\nIs it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?\nI will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:18,22 What then are we to do?

No wavering. No second guessing. None at all.\nJesus said \u0026hellip; ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 5:36 Such trust is life and health and strength. Why would anyone not live like this? And yet many do not.\nRecall with me the sorry saga of the Israelites failing to trust the Lord, their ongoing enslavement to fear and uncertainty and doubt. And recall too the Lord\u0026rsquo;s uncompromising response, his righteous anger burning against them, his chosen people, his beloved ones.\nWhat reason did the Israelites have to trust the Lord?\nIn the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:12-16 This is the God who miraculously delivered his people from slavery in Egypt, parting the waters of the Red Sea so they could pass safely. And led them through the desert, miraculously guiding them and remaining with them. And slaked their thirst in the desert, again, miraculously.\nAnd he fed them with manna from heaven.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day\u0026rsquo;s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 16:4 Here was the test. This is the trust test. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that the Israelites faced time and again. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that we ourselves face time and again.\nAnd how did they do, those Israelites, those chosen people, those beloved ones?\nThey forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:11 They forgot all the reasons they had to trust him! Their earlier fear of the Lord and belief in him was so feeble it had simply evaporated like the morning mist.\nBut it gets worse.\nYet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. They spoke against God, saying, ‚ÄúCan God spread a table in the wilderness? He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 78:17-20 Can you hear the sneering doubt here, the sheer contempt for their provider, the complete absence of trust? O my soul, be appalled.\nTherefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:21-22 Paul explains.\nFor I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:1-5 They drank from the Rock which was Christ no less and yet they failed the trust test. Overthrown means struck down. In judgment for their lack of trust most of them were struck down by the Lord, their hitherto protector and provider, the Faithful One. Most of them!\nThe anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:31 Why did this happen?\nBecause they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:22 This is how important it is to trust, to believe, to depend upon the Lord without wavering.\nAnd what of our own trust test?\nO my soul, even when things are very dark indeed you must trust the Lord and depend upon him relentlessly. He is faithful and true. Never doubt that!\nWho among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.\n‚Äï Isaiah 50:10 Trust is tested when our lives are at stake, when our hearts are breaking, when things are entirely beyond us and all we can do is depend upon the Lord, upon his faithfulness to all that he has promised and to all that he is, when the way ahead is unseeable. But without the unseeable there can be no faith! O my soul, will you trust him then? Will you trust him now? Will you continue to trust him?\nNow hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.\n‚Äï Romans 8:24-25 O my soul, in this waiting time of unseeing are you tempted to doubt? Are you tempted to despair? Are you tempted to run ahead of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will in your own strength? Resist! You must resist! Hold on to what is true. Hold on to the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nNo temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:13 You can endure this, O my soul. Repudiate doubt and all that drags you down, and trust him. Trust him! You must endure with steadfast faith, believing and not doubting. Trust Jesus, whose name is Faithful and True!\nThe penalty for failing the truth test is severe, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen.

Fear not, O my soul. You have been redeemed by the Creator God of the universe. Called by him. Known by him. Belonging to him. Rejoice in that ineffable truth and embrace the forming of purity and blamelessness in your own life!\nKnow this: you are called by name. Your name is who you are. It is your character. You are fully known by the one who calls. There is nothing that the Lord could subsequently learn about you which would change how he regards you. You are called and you are known and you are his.\nDo you remember God\u0026rsquo;s question to Jacob after the wrestling?\nAnd he said to him, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúJacob.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 32:27 What is God asking here? He is the omniscient and all powerful Creator God of the universe and he asks, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù He is not seeking information! The question to Jacob is, what kind of man are you? And Jacob confesses his name‚∏∫the cheat, the deceiver, vile and despicable.\nThen he said, ‚ÄúYour name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel.\n‚Äï Genesis 32:28 Behold! God is the one who makes all things new! Praise him!\nAnd marvel at the extent to which the Lord will go to do this. Isaiah continues.\nFor I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour. I give Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in exchange for you. Because you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:3-4 He is my saviour. He is your saviour. The ransom is costly and there is no limit to where he will go for the rescue, because I am precious in his eyes, and honoured. Because you are precious, and he loves you.\n‚ÄúI give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.‚Äù\nO my soul, he gave one man in particular in return for you: Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, in exchange for your life. In exchange for mine.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\n‚Äï John 3:16 The ransom is costly. But fear not, O my soul, he has redeemed you!\nSo why are you here? Why do you exist? What were you created for?\nBut now thus says the LORD\nBecause you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n\u0026hellip; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:1, 4, 6-7 You were created for the glory of God. He set his love upon you, called you by name, poured out that great love at Calvary, and redeemed you. There is no higher calling than for the glory of God. It is why I am here. It is why you are here. And as we receive that great Calvary love may all see it for what it is and give God the glory due his name. Be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God!\nThe wrestling is done, O my soul. It\u0026rsquo;s time for that to end. You have been bought at a price‚∏∫an unfathomable price. But that price has been paid, and in full.\nNow may your love abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\nRejoice, O my soul, to know the magnitude of the reason why you are here. It is for the glory of God! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-18T06:30:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/created-for-his-glory/mohamed-nohassi-odxB5oIG_iA-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1846373_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/created-for-his-glory/","title":"Created for his glory"},{"content":"O my soul,\nAre you weary? So very weary? So weary in fact that you wonder whether you can carry on at all, even not quite knowing what that would mean?\nBut what is it that we are commanded to do?\nRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\n‚Äï Romans 12:12 Be patient in tribulation. And go on being patient. And on. And on. Being patient. In tribulation.\nBut when will it all end? Will it ever end? How can you continue to endure this, O my soul? Isn\u0026rsquo;t the prolonged nature of it all simply wearing you down?\nHave you made Job\u0026rsquo;s heart-cry your very own?\nBut I don‚Äôt have the strength to endure. I have nothing to live for.\n‚Äï Job 6:11 NLT Will it ever end? What is there to live for? Does anything even matter any more?\nO my Soul, listen to Jesus.\nBy your endurance you will gain your lives.\n‚Äï Luke 21:19 Jesus is speaking of the great tribulation, but it makes no difference. By your endurance you will gain your life, O my soul. Your endurance matters then, O how it matters! Your life depends upon it. But what is it exactly? What is this endurance by which you will gain your life, beyond simply managing to exist through the trial? What indeed? And where will this endurance come from, that you may live?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first consider the why, and through that understand the what and the how.\nFor you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:36 O my soul, do you want to receive what is promised? Do you want to receive what has been promised from the one whose name is Faithful and True? Then you have need of endurance!\nThis endurance is what will enable you to do the will of God, and to keep on doing it. So now we must ask, what is the will of God here?\nThen they said to him, ‚ÄúWhat must we do, to be doing the works of God?‚Äù Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúThis is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 6:28-29 So this is it. This is what it means to endure. Believe in Jesus, the one whom the Lord has sent! Above all else this means trust him. Trust him, absolutely and completely, and depend upon him, and on him alone.\nTrust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.\n‚Äï Proverbs 3:5-6 My own understanding is quite simply not up to the task. This is entirely beyond me. O my soul, at that point beyond which you cannot understand what or why or how, you must surrender your need to understand, and simply trust the one who does‚∏∫the one whose name is Faithful and True. Trust Jesus! And depend on him!\nBe mindful that straight does not mean easy, but it does mean that there is a way. There is a way ahead, and by taking one step after another on this straight path, trusting and not doubting, you can continue. You can continue, O my soul, so do that!\nAnd as you resolve to continue to take this path ahead, wondering whether you have the strength even for that, you must understand where strength comes from. It comes from hope. Hold on to hope. The one who promised is Faithful and True. Rejoice in that hope!\nRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\n‚Äï Romans 12:12 Strength comes from hope. It comes from trust.\nThose who trust in the LORD will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.\n‚Äï Isaiah 40:31 NLT O my Soul, I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to soaring on wings like an eagle, as that may be inconceivable for now. But know this. The word used for trust is the Hebrew q√¢v√¢h, which could be translated wait for, or hope in, or expect. Yes, more waiting. More waiting, O my soul, but waiting in hope. And rejoicing in that hope. Paul and Isaiah are perfectly aligned.\nRejoice in hope. Trust in and depend on Jesus, that he may be the one to lift you up. Oh, and be constant in prayer.\nTrust in the Lord, O my soul, and find there new strength to carry on! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-11T06:30:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/my-strength-is-almost-gone/todd-trapani-v2Jf_jpNamc-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_11477103_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/my-strength-is-almost-gone/","title":"My strength is almost gone"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat happened yesterday?\nWere you hoping for great things? Were you expecting great things? And are you tempted to say, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù? That nothing happened? (You would be so very wrong about that, by the way.)\nAnd if you think that nothing happened yesterday, now what? What will you do now? Where is hope? How can hope survive the passing of yet another day, the unrelenting accumulation of which become inexorable years? How can faith survive this, O my soul? How will this rollercoaster of expectation and disappointment not simply grind you down into the dust?\nHow indeed?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how. There are three reasons. The first reason is to understand that disappointment is a lie.\nDisappointment is a lie because it presupposes failure. But what failure would that be, exactly?\nListen to Joshua, now old and well advanced in years, passing on some wisdom at the end of his own life to those who would come after him.\nAnd now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.\n‚Äï Joshua 23:14 Not one of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promises had failed, nor has failed, nor will fail. Know that he is faithful and true, O my soul, to all that he has said, and to all that he is!\nAnd if you think that what you were hoping for yesterday didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, what you were expecting, what you were so committed in faith to receiving, then listen to the Lord himself, speaking through Isaiah.\n‚ÄúI am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,‚Äô calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:9-11 For sure, there are things not yet done, but there is none like God, declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient times. O my soul, he will do it! He will accomplish all he has purposed! Know that nothing has failed. Trust him still and praise him!\nThe second reason is because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts. Poured out for you, O my soul.\nTherefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,‚ÄØand hope does not put us to shame, because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:1-5 I will have to return another time to rejoicing in our sufferings but for now consider just that final verse, for which the Berean Standard Bible rendition is particularly helpful.\nAnd hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:5 BSB Hope does not disappoint. God himself is both the giver and the one who pours. It is his own great love. He poured out that same love at Calvary, O my soul. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God!\nThe third and final reason is to understand at least something of what did actually happen yesterday.\nWhat was I hoping for? Isaiah knows.\nOh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:1 I was hoping that the Creator God of the Universe, awesome in power and terrifying in purity but also so very good and kind, would break into this impossible situation, breathing out grace and truth and power into my own life and those around me.\nSo did he?\nFrom of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:4 Isaiah tells us that the Lord acts. Not that he will act, or even that he did act, but that he acts, in the present tense. He is working right now with great power for those who wait for him. Will you be that, O my soul? Will you continue to be that?\nAnd what is it that he is doing?\nHabbakuk knows and it cannot be told. The Lord himself declares it.\n‚ÄúLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.‚Äù\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 Wonder and be astounded, O my soul, at what the Lord is already doing in your life, and renounce disappointment! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-04T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/istrfry-marcus-NX0WjgdQl58-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1794935_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/","title":"That was yesterday"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhen do you expect change will come?\nAfter so many years spent hoping and trusting, holding on to your promise from the Lord and yet still waiting, are you tempted to give up?\nOr do you still somehow expect that the Lord will act with great power to fulfil that promise? And when exactly do you expect that?\nThere is only one answer which honours the Lord and that is today. You must continue to expect it and you must expect it today! It is imperative that you do so. Your very faith depends upon it. Your life and health and strength depend upon it. How else could you live a life that honours him, other than in complete trust and dependence upon him, and other than in expectation of the imminent outworking of his great power in your life?\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23 He who promised is indeed faithful. His very name is Faithful and True (Rev 19:11).\nBut why is it quite so important to hold fast to this hope, this expectation of imminent fulfilment, without wavering?\nWe are in the midst of a spiritual battle and the fighting is fierce. To expect anything other than imminent fulfilment would open the door to doubt ‚∏∫that doubt which is so ready to creep in and steal away hope and joy and expectation. That doubt which would cause all to unravel and expose the tattered remains of a faith which once was. That doubt which must be resisted with all strength. Be steadfast, O my soul! Cry out to the Faithful One, Lord I believe! Help my unbelief!\nSo Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. And Elijah came near to all the people and said, ‚ÄúHow long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.‚Äù And the people did not answer him a word.\nAnd they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, ‚ÄúO Baal, answer us!‚Äù But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‚ÄúCry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:20-21, 26-27 O my soul, are you tempted to such thoughts while you wait on the living God, the God of your life? Repudiate them!\nAnd at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, ‚ÄúO LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.‚Äù Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, ‚ÄúThe LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:36-39 The Lord, he is God! Praise him, O my soul!\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer to our most earnest praying, the outworking of his mighty strength in our lives to fulfil all that he has promised, is that all may know that the Lord, he is God! And his grace and kindness is that you, O my soul, may know it. Expect it today!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nOur experience of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power being outworked in our lives is limited only by our faith to believe it, our faith to receive it. This is why it is quite so important that we do not hold back in expectation.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30 O my soul, do you believe that he is able to do this? According to your faith be it done to you. Do not hold back in expectation!\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s yet more.\n‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 3:16-18 What do you dare to believe, O my soul, of the only Son of God. Do not hold back in expectation!\nThis is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:24 This is the day, O my soul!

Are you grieving for things that once were and are no longer? So was the psalmist.\nThese things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:4 Here is a man who used to live a life of affirmation and exaltation. But things changed and he became a pariah, even in his own church.\nAs with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:10 Or perhaps, O my soul, does the Lord seem to have withdrawn? Are you no longer enjoying that intimacy, the sweetness of his felt presence in your life? Nor was the psalmist. But the desire for that had not left him.\nMy soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:2-3 The multitude keeping festival, those privileged and self-satisfied ones, had closed ranks, and he was no longer among them. And it seemed to him that God himself had passed him by, forgotten him, rejected him. He was oppressed, scorned, and despised.\nIs there any hope? Is anything to be done?\nWhy are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation‚ÄØand my God.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:5-6, also v11 and Psalm 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? This is not a question in search of an answer. This is a rebuke. It is a rebuke delivered to one who has taken their eyes off the Lord, and has become overwhelmed by their own difficulties and disappointments, defeated by them and yet dwelling in them.\nHope in God, O my soul! Hope in the only one in whom you really can!\nMy soul does indeed thirst for God. But where is hope?\nBy day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:8 His love is steadfast. All his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness (Psalm 25:10). And he is the God of my life‚∏∫the God of my whole life.\nThe Lord is not ignorant of nor indifferent to what is happening in my life. He has plans and purposes for me that are beyond my understanding. He is ambitious for me in ways that would blow my mind if I only knew. He is transforming me into the likeness of Christ, and he knows how to do it, O how he knows! He is the God of my life.\nWhat must I do then? I must trust. I must trust the God of my life, who knows his work.\nAnd what is this song that is with me through the night, when tears are my only food? The psalmist knew.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:14 Isaiah knew.\n‚ÄúBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 12:2 But these are borrowed words. They are Moses\u0026rsquo; words. This is Moses\u0026rsquo; song.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father\u0026rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.\n‚Äï Exodus 15:2 And what is the context of Moses\u0026rsquo; song?\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\nThus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.\n‚Äï Exodus 14:21, 30-31 This song must be the refrain of your life: the habit of remembering who the Lord is and what he has done. It is the habit of remembering as you do the dishes, as you drive to work, as you grapple with the challenges of life. It is the habit of remembering the God of your life and the great power that he uses to rescue those he loves. Dwell in that, my soul.\nAnd do not underestimate the discipline and determination required to sing this song, to make it the habit of your life, but this you must do, single-mindedly, doggedly, courageously. It is a matter of life and death. Take your eyes off yourself, look to the Lord and hope in him. There is no other.\nHope in the Lord, O my soul, for there is no other! üôè\n","date":"2024-05-21T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/jeremy-bishop-DLICfSD33as-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2634415_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/","title":"Hope in God"}]
