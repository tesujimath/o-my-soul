[{"content":"O my soul,\nIs that righteous anger we examined last week the right response to all the sin in the world, that sin which corrupts and stains everything, that sin which we see all around us?\nBy no means!\nJesus came to the temple on another occasion, and this visit was so very different.\nEarly in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, ‚ÄúTeacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:2-5 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this woman epitomise all that\u0026rsquo;s wrong with society? Everyone choosing to do what they want with no regard for God\u0026rsquo;s holy law, and no regard for the cost in human suffering and shame? Surely that righteous anger is the fitting response to such a thing, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you say?\nThe Pharisees were clearly angry, but let\u0026rsquo;s pause for a moment and look into the reason for their anger.\nThis they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him.\n‚Äï John 8:6a In truth they didn\u0026rsquo;t really care about honouring the Lord, and they certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the woman herself‚∏∫she evidently meant nothing to them. They were out to test Jesus, to bring a charge against him, to bring him down. Perhaps they saw him as soft on sin, or at least soft on sinners. Their aim was to trap him into contradicting the law so that they could discredit him. Is this not precisely the behaviour of vain and dishonest men of rank? Theirs was so clearly not a righteous anger then.\nAnd what of Jesus\u0026rsquo; righteous anger that we saw previously?\nJesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, ‚ÄúLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.‚Äù And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus stood up and said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNo one, Lord.‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúNeither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:6b-11 Upon being confronted with their own sinfulness, and beginning with the older ones, they went away one by one.\nBeginning with the older ones. Perhaps only eventually do each of us understand how far we fall short. Is there not sometimes a harshness to be seen among the younger generation in their zealous pursuit of what is right and true? Perhaps only with the passage of time and the humble recognition of ongoing failure and shame in our own lives is each of us able to say with Paul,\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 1:15b Let\u0026rsquo;s put aside then that righteous anger that Jesus would have been feeling towards those vain and dishonest men of rank, and ask, what was he feeling towards the adulterous woman?‚∏∫for the answer to that addresses our opening question on how we should respond to all that sin and brokenness we see in the world, that sin which corrupts all. Notice what he said.\nJesus stood up and said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNo one, Lord.‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúNeither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:10-11 Jesus did not condemn and he does not condemn, but it matters that each one sin no more. O my soul, from now on sin no more. Your Saviour demands it! And listen to Jesus explain why he came.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.\n‚Äï John 3:16-17 And so the answer is compassion, not anger.\nThe Father\u0026rsquo;s compassion for our broken and dysfunctional world and our own brokenness was the reason for sending his only Son to rescue and redeem, to die at Calvary where that great love was poured out for all, and to rise again in resurrection victory and power over sin and death and all that corrupts and spoils.\nWe do need to pause however and ask whether the Pharisees had a point. In all his compassion, is Jesus in fact soft on sin? And if his sacrifice at Calvary was sufficient to pay the debt of eight billion sinners, why would we any longer be concerned about the sin that remains. Cannot all be forgiven?\nO my soul, do not so quickly forget Jesus\u0026rsquo; final words to the adulterous woman.\nGo, and from now on sin no more.\n‚Äï John 8:11b What else did Jesus have to say about this?\nWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, ‚Äòwhere their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.‚Äô\n‚Äï Mark 9:42-48 Are these the words of one who is soft on sin? O my soul, you must purge the sin from your own life, and you must be ruthless in this. Do not tolerate it any longer. Do not be deceived‚∏∫look ahead to what will happen at the end of this present age.\nThen I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.\n‚Äï Revelation 20:11-12 Tremble at these things, and be grateful for the book of life, written at such great cost by the author of life. Such is compassion.\nSo thank and praise the Lord for his compassion which rescues and redeems. Put aside your righteous anger before it becomes self-righteousness, soften your heart, and reach out with compassion and kindness and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great rescue for this broken world.\nO my soul, learn to live with humility as one who was once lost and is now saved, put aside that anger, and put on a grateful and compassionate heart! üôè\n","date":"2024-11-01T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/do-not-be-angry/cas-holmes-_zyt1WWWdv4-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2601689_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/do-not-be-angry/","title":"Do not be angry"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat do you make of this?\nBe angry, and do not sin;\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4a Be angry. Why? It is commanded! And in that, do not sin. How? How can this be done? We\u0026rsquo;ll need to give some serious thought to this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by considering the new life that is in Christ. Paul sets the context.\nIf then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:1-4 Let\u0026rsquo;s not progress past this too quickly‚∏∫it is heady truth indeed! I have died and my life is hidden with Christ in God. My eternal being is secure and unassailable. Indeed my very life is Christ. Praise the Lord!\nAnd what then? Paul continues in typical fashion with a therefore.\nPut to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:5-8 None of these have any place in the new life, and of these things that must be put away, did you notice that anger appeared first in the list? But still,\nBe angry, and do not sin;\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4a We may conclude that there are two different kinds of anger. And indeed the words are different.\nFor the anger which must be put aside, having no place in the new life in Christ, Paul uses the Greek word orgƒì, which is an anger full of emotion, violent passion in fact. This is the anger of not getting one\u0026rsquo;s own way. It is the anger of a bruised ego. And the word used for wrath means rage or passion. It is selfish, even childish in its inability to show restraint. Those must be put aside.\nThe psalmist wrote in Hebrew, which precludes direct comparison, but Paul also writes of the anger of the psalmist.\nBe angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:26 Here he uses the Greek word parorgismos, which means indignation or wrath or exasperation. This is not rage. This is a righteous anger.\nSo, the command is to be angry with that righteous anger, with indignation at what ought not to be. But what is that? What should be the object of such anger? To answer that let\u0026rsquo;s consider what was the object of Jesus\u0026rsquo; anger‚∏∫for from time to time he was indeed angry.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one example.\nAnd they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, ‚ÄúIs it not written, ‚ÄòMy house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?‚Äô But you have made it a den of robbers.‚Äù And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.\n‚Äï Mark 11:15-18 Those who were the subject of his anger were very much on the inside of the religious establishment of the day, but their behaviour was brazen in its dishonouring of the Lord. Worthy of anger, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you agree?\nThe way each gospel writer orders their account is interesting and surely rich in meaning. There\u0026rsquo;s just such a juxtaposition here which must be noticed, for this account of Jesus clearing the temple is immediately followed by this.\nAs they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, ‚ÄúRabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 11:20-21 O my soul, do you recall how I grappled previously with this hard teaching of the poor little fig tree being cursed for failing to bear figs out of season?\nJesus\u0026rsquo; anger with that fig tree paralleled his anger with the Pharisees‚∏∫those heinously prideful ones who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom but were not.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s return to our psalm and observe the context out of which it is written.\nAnswer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!\n‚Äï Psalm 4:1 Considering the psalm as a whole we see a man earnestly desiring to live a right life before the Lord while being so very aware of his dependence upon the Lord for that. O my soul, do you know this humble passion for personal holiness combined with complete dependence on Christ for his righteousness? I know that you do!\nThe psalmist has been in distress previously, and is again, and why is that?\nO men, how long shall my honour be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?\n‚Äï Psalm 4:2 The psalmist is despised and rejected by vain and dishonest men. And who are they? Their description is nuanced, literally sons of men. The ESV alternative translation renders it men of rank. So, privileged ones. Exalted ones. Vain and dishonest. Pharisees.\nBe angry, O my soul, you must be angry at that which ought not to be, that which so dishonours the Lord, that pride and hypocrisy. And do not sin.\nSo how are we not to sin in this? There are two ways. The psalmist tells us the first right away.\nBe angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4-5 O my soul, in your own righteous anger know that you are not called to table-flipping and temple-clearing. That is Jesus\u0026rsquo; work. Ponder on your bed and be silent. Put your trust in the Lord. Do you think he hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen this heinous behaviour? Do you think he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know? Do you think he won\u0026rsquo;t respond?\nAnd Paul tells us the second.\nBe angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:26-27 Do you see? Do not let the sun go down on your anger. Do not hold on to it. You must lay it down and let it go.\nBeloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, ‚ÄúVengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 12:19 And where does that leave the psalmist? Blessed and at peace.\nYou have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound. In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:7-8 O my soul, be angry and do not sin! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-25T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/todd-trapani-91T-rq-pY28-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1764464_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/","title":"Be angry"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is the most truly overwhelming outworking of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s discover that in the psalmist\u0026rsquo;s song of praise.\nPraise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for he is beautiful, and a song of praise is fitting. The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names. Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure. The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:1-6 Recall as I explained to Amy that he is beautiful, the alternative translation given in the ESV is the correct one, the reason why it is good to praise the Lord, why a song of praise is fitting. Just pause and rejoice in that for a moment. Praise the Lord, for he is beautiful! Yes indeed he is, in every way!\nAs we praise the infinitely powerful Creator God of the Universe, let\u0026rsquo;s consider for a moment that cosmic power which is his to deploy.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a very real danger of feeling overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the universe he has created. Here in our psalm we read that he determines the number of the stars and he gives to all of them their names. In the creation account we read similarly.\nAnd God made the two great lights‚∏∫the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night‚∏∫and the stars.\n‚Äï Genesis 1:16 He made the sun and the moon, and by the way, he also made the stars.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something of a by-the-way about the stars in our psalm too. Notice the order in which various praiseworthy attributes are listed.\nHe builds up the city of his people; he gathers the outcasts; he binds up the brokenhearted; oh, and by the way, he also determines the number of the stars.\nO my soul, can you see the remarkable truth here? Let\u0026rsquo;s not be so dazzled by the enormity of the physical universe that we lose sight of what is really on the Lord\u0026rsquo;s heart‚∏∫his beloved ones, and especially among them, the brokenhearted, whom he so tenderly and with great compassion binds up and does his miraculous work of healing.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s instead be overwhelmed by this then, that the Lord has set his love on undeserving sinners, and especially on the outcast and the downtrodden and the brokenhearted. And furthermore that he works in them and for them with that very same cosmic power‚∏∫a work of rescue and healing and liberation from the bonds of sin and lifting up of the humble.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s remind ourselves of that passage in Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy from which Jesus read at the beginning of his earthly ministry, for we see there a similar priority.\nAnd he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\n‚Äï Luke 4:16-17 Reading directly from Isaiah, as Jesus did:\nThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s favour, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion‚∏∫to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.\n‚Äï Isaiah 61:1-3 And continuing in Luke\u0026rsquo;s gospel,\nAnd he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 4:20-21 Again, let\u0026rsquo;s be overwhelmed that the Creator God of the Universe cares quite so much about his beloved ones, his brokenhearted ones and those that are oppressed, that he sent his only son, Jesus. This was Jesus\u0026rsquo; mission, and it remains so‚∏∫to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s favour, and to comfort all who mourn.\nO my soul, do you mourn? Know that the Lord is making beauty from the ashes of your own life. Receive his wonderful comfort and be clothed in his garment of praise.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one more thing to notice here. These oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord‚∏∫did you notice who they are? They are in fact these very rescued ones, these liberated captives, these ones with a faint spirit. How is it possible that the bruised and broken and downtrodden become mighty oaks of righteousness in the Kingdom? It is simply because of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power in restoration and transforming grace‚∏∫his cosmic power. And we are even told why, that is, why the Lord does this work of rescue and transformation and planting. It is so that he may be glorified. Praise and magnify his holy name!\nThe Lord is glorified when his character is revealed and made known to the nations‚∏∫his character which is forgiveness and rescue and steadfast love and faithfulness, as he declared to Moses.\nThe LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:5-7 It turns out that making the stars was indeed very much of a by-the-way!\nO my soul, rest in the arms of your Heavenly Father who binds up the brokenhearted, and receive his rescue and healing and transforming grace! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2024-10-18T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/cosmic-power/42916480792-cd4b5fcfdf-o_huff7b18306ec83afc2f073a03ef20a667_4202873_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/cosmic-power/","title":"Cosmic power"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow does a church completely and comprehensively lose its way?\nAnd to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‚ÄòThe words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God\u0026rsquo;s creation.\n‚ÄòI know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 3:14-17 O my soul, grieve with Jesus over this self-satisfied and delusional church. And grieve further over their complete and unmitigated failure and shame. Recall that even in that dead church in Sardis there were some who had not soiled their garments, who being worthy would walk with Jesus in white. In Laodicea no such are mentioned.\nHow could there have been such a gulf between how Jesus saw the church and how they saw themselves? Laodicea was a wealthy city and we may deduce that its church also was affluent and middle-class, seeing itself as rich in every way, lacking nothing. But how self-satisfied they were!\nThey thought they were rich, but they had failed to understand the currency of eternity. In reality they were paupers. And if they saw themselves as discerning, in reality they were blind.\nLaodicea was entirely deception and delusion, but Jesus knew, and he knew they were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. How had this happened? How does this happen to any church which seems to be richly blessed, which maybe even gives the appearance of delighting in the Lord? Perhaps they had simply made their lives all about themselves.\nIsaiah prophecies against just such. Note well the nature of the offence.\nCry aloud; do not hold back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:1-2 See how the house of Jacob delighted to draw near to God. Everything was simply magnificent, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nNo. No it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. O my soul, be appalled at their pride and listen to their self-justification.\nWhy have we fasted, and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:3a The Lord thought otherwise.\nBehold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:3b Notice how they were rebuked for their self-interest and lack of concern for others, and be dismayed with quite how much this contradicted what the Lord required.\nIs not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:6-7 What did Jesus say later?\nA new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\n‚Äï John 13:34-35 Do you see? Loving one another is the barometer of discipleship.\nAnd humility? In their pride and self-satisfaction, how many Laodiceans would have been able to identify with Paul in saying,\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 1:15b I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure the answer would have been none. Certainly none are mentioned by Jesus in his letter. In all six of the other churches, Jesus found at least something to commend‚∏∫even in Sardis. But here, nothing.\nO my soul, wake up to this reality! Jesus\u0026rsquo; warning is as urgent as it is vital.\nNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?‚Äô And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô\n‚Äï Matthew 7:21-23 Now recall that those Philadelphians, with such little power, were commended by Jesus without reservation. Do we see in Laodicea a church condemned without reservation? No we don\u0026rsquo;t‚∏∫at least not that terrible and final condemnation.\nO my soul, marvel over the grace and generosity in Jesus\u0026rsquo; lavish invitation to this prideful and delusional church.\nI counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:18-19 Jesus had not given up on this smug and self-satisfied church, and neither must you. They were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked, and yet look what Jesus was offering. Was it not exactly what they needed? What they really needed? And all they had to do to receive these things was to repent.\nQuite unlike that open door in Philadelphia, the Laodiceans had firmly closed their own door. But listen again to Jesus.\nBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:20 This is Jesus\u0026rsquo; urgent invitation to prideful ones who have completely and comprehensively lost their way. Astonishingly, final condemnation is held back, and what is offered in its place is an invitation to repent.\nMarvel at this.\nThe one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:21-22 O my soul, listen to what Jesus is saying, repent of self-interest and self-satisfaction, humble yourself, and reach out with love for others! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-11T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/self-satisfied-and-delusional/nick-fewings-XpG9JaN_SXQ-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3622405_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/self-satisfied-and-delusional/","title":"Self-satisfied and delusional"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow does an open door constitute a reward?\nAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‚ÄòThe words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.\n‚ÄòI know your works.

Jesus knew their works. What a joy it must have been for him to commend their faithfulness and to richly reward them. So let\u0026rsquo;s consider the reward of that open door. And let\u0026rsquo;s start by asking, how does that even constitute a reward?\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t an open door simply an opportunity presenting itself? Indeed Paul uses exactly this metaphor on several occasions. Here are two examples.\nBut I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 16:8-9 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison‚∏∫that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.\n‚Äï Colossians 4:2-4 Truly the opportunity here was not presenting itself but rather was being presented as a sovereign work of the Lord. Paul was most concerned about the open door for declaring the mystery of Christ, that he may make it clear‚∏∫of course he was. But I am not persuaded that this was the nature of the reward for the Philadelphians.\nPerhaps there\u0026rsquo;s a clue in Jesus\u0026rsquo; next letter.\nBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:20 Jesus is not knocking on the Philadelphian door because it is already open and he is right there among them. This is the door to heaven itself, just as John\u0026rsquo;s vision continues.\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‚ÄúCome up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.‚Äù At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.\n‚Äï Revelation 4:1-3 What a door this is! And it is wide open and cannot be shut. What a reward!\nIn passing we must enjoy to notice John\u0026rsquo;s ludicrous attempt to describe the indescribable, the one seated on the throne. He who was seated there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. Really? Is that the best he could have done? It tells us nothing. Except of course of the ineffability of the Creator God of the Universe, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. Praise his holy name! And praise his indescribable being!\nBefore we continue to think about that door, let\u0026rsquo;s consider what was being rewarded, for it seems to be so very little.\nI know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.\nBecause you have kept my word about patient endurance \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Revelation 3:8b, 10a And that\u0026rsquo;s the entirety of it! But make no mistake, this is not so very little at all. We need to understand what this means, to keep Jesus\u0026rsquo; word and not to deny his name. It is in fact about absolute trust and complete surrender and living an uncompromised life which is fully consistent and perfectly aligned with Jesus being Lord of all. And it is about that personal holiness which is an ongoing act of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; name is his character. It is who he is. So what would deny his name? Would it not be anxiety or doubt or inconsistency or pretence or pride or holding anything back?\nO my soul, do you understand the magnitude of what was being commended? Marvel at it, and now go and do likewise! And if you think you simply lack the strength to live like this, observe that the Philadelphians also had but little power. The power to live like this is all the Lord\u0026rsquo;s and it is his gift of grace. Praise him!\nBut back to this open door. Jesus tells us a bit more about it.\nSo Jesus again said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\n‚Äï John 10:7-10 Jesus is the door, and he is the door to life itself. Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. O my soul, are you starting to understand the magnitude of the Philadelphian reward?\nAnd there is something else which must not be overlooked. What does Jesus say of those who have not lived this pure and holy and surrendered life?\n\u0026hellip; and they will learn that I have loved you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:9b O my soul, have you learnt this? Have you learnt that the King of the Universe has loved you with an everlasting love?\nAnd finally, do not overlook that the abundant life is this life!\nNow to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.\n‚Äï Ephesians 3:20-21 O my soul, live like those Philadelphians, and receive from Jesus the reward of that open door! üôè\n","date":"2024-10-04T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/chris-meads-VDHn0YmjIw4-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_5391919_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/","title":"The open door"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is reputed to be alive but is in fact dead?\nOne answer of course is the church in Sardis.\nAnd to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.\n‚ÄòI know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 3:1 (But we would be fools to think this is the only answer.)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what we can understand about Jesus\u0026rsquo; diagnosis of this dead church. Firstly and quite surprisingly, given the severity of the indictment, doesn\u0026rsquo;t his judgment seem to be rather non-specific?\nHere it is in its entirety.\nWake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:2-3 What has been going on here?\nThere are works but they are not complete. What was received and heard has been forgotten. Repentance is required. And they are asleep. Jesus\u0026rsquo; verdict is that the net effect of these apparently innocuous elements is that the church is dead. Dead, no less!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see if we can understand how that could be.\nThe word used to describe those works which were not complete is the Greek verb plƒìro≈ç, which mostly gets translated fulfilled or fulfil. Their works were not fulfilled. So we should ask, what would be works that were fulfilled? Paul tells us, using the parallel Greek noun plƒìr≈çma.\nLove is the fulfilling of the law.\n‚Äï Romans 13:10b Perhaps there was a deficit of love in Sardis.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s consider what could have been received and heard and subsequently forgotten.\nMore than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.\n‚Äï Romans 5:11 For if, because of one man\u0026rsquo;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.\n‚Äï Romans 5:17 For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 8:15 What had been received was reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters, by whom we cry, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù\nO my soul, grieve with Jesus that this could have been forgotten. How could this be? What could possibly happen that such things be forgotten? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. What happens is that pride enters the human heart, and self-satisfaction displaces gratitude such that one\u0026rsquo;s own status as one who has been rescued is no longer foremost in the mind. It is pride and self-satisfaction that kill humble gratitude and love.\nSo if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:1-3 Just as in the church in Thyatira so too in Sardis there was a call to repent. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it complacency which deafens ears to such a call?\nAnd Jesus urges them to wake up lest he come like a thief in the night, unexpected and frankly unwelcome. Does this not remind us of Jesus\u0026rsquo; warning to his own disciples, concerning his return in glory?\n‚ÄúBut concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. Therefore stay awake‚∏∫for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning‚∏∫lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 13:32-37 O my soul, stay awake!\nAnd tremble also because of Jesus\u0026rsquo; words to the church in Sardis.\nIf you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:3b Against you! Against the ones who had received reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters. These ones who were now found by Jesus to be on the other side.\nO my soul, was there ever such complacency? But wake up. It is in fact all around us. All. Around. Us.\nBut despite this we must notice something vital. While it may have been endemic, this spirit of complacency had not vanquished all.\nYet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.\n‚Äï Revelation 3:4 O my soul, do not despair. There was a faithful remnant, even here.\nSo what is to be done? Two things.\nFirstly, be appalled at those who have soiled their garments. Those complacent ones. Those who have a reputation of being alive but are in fact dead.\nSecondly, put aside your own complacency and smug self-satisfaction, choose the path of humility, and walk with Jesus in white. And you must be careful to understand what that means.\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, ‚ÄúSalvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!‚Äù\nThen one of the elders addressed me, saying, ‚ÄúWho are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?‚Äù I said to him, ‚ÄúSir, you know.‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúThese are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\n‚Äï Revelation 7:9-10, 13-14 There is no other way to walk with Jesus in white other than by being washed in the blood of the Lamb, other than by receiving reconciliation, abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, and the Spirit of adoption as sons and daughters. And holding on to these with humble gratitude! O my soul, hold on to these precious gifts.\nBut God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ‚∏∫by grace you have been saved‚∏∫and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:4-9 So walk with a grateful heart in humility, as one rescued, as one whose life now belongs to another. For it is so.\nO my soul, wash your robes in the blood of the Lamb and walk worthy! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-27T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/fooled-by-our-own-reputation/julio-rionaldo-CmuCyTRBDGg-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_842827_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/fooled-by-our-own-reputation/","title":"Fooled by our own reputation"},{"content":"O my soul,\nCan you hear Jesus\u0026rsquo; urgent call to repent?\nThis call to repent went out long ago to the church in Thyatira and it remains today. But let\u0026rsquo;s first marvel at Jesus\u0026rsquo; generous assessment of that church.\nAnd to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: ‚ÄòThe words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze.\n‚ÄòI know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 2:18-19 Among the church in Thyatira were these commended by Jesus for their love and faith and service and patient endurance. O my soul, how are your own love and faith and service and patient endurance? Jesus knows! His eyes are like a flame of fire and nothing is hidden from him.\nAnd did you notice the generosity in his assessment? Their latter works exceeded the first‚∏∫some were slow starters. Jesus did not dwell on what came before. He commended them for how they were now. O my soul, leave the past behind! Jesus does not dwell on what came before and nor must you. Know that he is generous in his assessment also of you, desiring for you only what is good. He loves you and is committed to you and demands reciprocity in these. Rejoice that it is so!\nBut it was not all good news in Thyatira.\nBut I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:20-21 Before we come specifically to the seduction and the sexual immorality, let\u0026rsquo;s notice something significant here‚∏∫a similarity and a difference with what we read in Jesus\u0026rsquo; letter to the church in Ephesus. Here we have a woman calling herself a prophetess and leading the church astray. In the church in Ephesus there were false apostles also leading the church astray. If that is the similarity what is the difference? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it that she was given time to repent and they were not? Recall that there was no call to repentance for those false apostles in Ephesus. They were simply excluded by Jesus and rejected. Tremble at that judgment and that rejection.\nNow our instinct may be to characterise Jezebel\u0026rsquo;s sin as utterly heinous, far worse than what was happening in Ephesus, but pause to consider that Jesus did in fact give her that time to repent. This is not something we can understand in its entirety but surely warns us off ranking sins and ranking sinners.\nAnd what of those she was leading astray?\nBehold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:22-23a Repent! O my soul, notice the urgency to repent. Jesus came to break the chains of bondage to sin and death and to give life in all its abundance, and repentance and faith are the means to receive this precious and lavish gift. But her children, her spiritual offspring who refuse this gift will be struck dead.\nAnd what is this death? Is it not that final, second death?\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:11 And what then of the specifics of the sin‚∏∫sexual immorality and eating of food sacrificed to idols. Of the former we can say one thing immediately.\nDo you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!\nFlee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 6:15, 18-20 How different this is from how our own world views such things. Sexual immorality deeply grieves the Lord, for it is a corruption and a debasement of his wonderful gift to those he made in his own image.\nBut there is something wider going on here. The pagan worship of the day was centred around ritual sexual acts with temple prostitutes and eating of food sacrificed to idols, and this had come in to the church. How this dishonoured the Lord! It was the worldliness of the day invading his church.\nAnd what of worldliness invading the church in our own time? How this dishonours the Lord! And lest you be thinking that what was being rebuked in Thyatira was merely outward behaviour, think again.\nAnd all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:23b Jesus is the one who searches mind and heart. Mind and heart are where the Lord is first honoured or dishonoured. As Jesus said,\nWhat comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\n‚Äï Mark 7:20-23 So what must you repent of? O my soul, do not brush this question aside in complacency. Jesus searches mind and heart, and so must you.\nKeep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.\n‚Äï Proverbs 4:23 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 And hear again Jesus\u0026rsquo; own voice.\n‚ÄúJust so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 15:10 O my soul, repent, leave the past behind, and bring joy before the angels of God! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-20T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/repent/cj-botha-PTztNC4yKY0-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_4204283_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/repent/","title":"Repent!"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHow is it that the smallest things are in fact the most important?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s notice something in Jesus\u0026rsquo; letter to the church in Pergamum.\n‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.\n‚Äú‚ÄòI know where you dwell, where Satan\u0026rsquo;s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:12-13 The city of Pergamum was dominated by worship of pagan deities and so the church there was right in the thick of the spiritual battle. But doesn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus\u0026rsquo; commendation seem to be of such a small thing? Simply holding fast his name? Is that all?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not underestimate what such apparently small things are ultimately all about.\nIn the context of forgiving a brother in Christ who has caused much pain, Paul writes this.\nFor this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 2:9 O my soul, are you obedient in everything? Even in apparently small things? Let\u0026rsquo;s consider just one such. Recall something Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.\n‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 5:27-28 Is this not an area which requires honest self-evaluation and ruthless self-discipline? And isn\u0026rsquo;t this precisely one of these apparently small things?\nConsider. As you drive through the student quarter on a balmy summer afternoon, are you noticing the oh-so-attractive and rather scantily clad students parading themselves? And what do your eyes do then? And where do your thoughts take you?\nDo you think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what your eyes are doing, because no-one sees? And where your thoughts are taking you, because no-one knows? It matters! Our Heavenly Father sees and our Heavenly Father knows. The choice between looking to the left or looking to the right is in fact the choice between disobedience and disrespect, or personal holiness and an act of worship. An act of worship to the one who loves you. The one who rescued you. The one who grieves over the vestigial sin in your life. O my soul, choose to honour him in this! Make every small victory over sin an act of worship, and keep your eyes to the right!\nIn the contexts of giving and praying and fasting, Jesus follows up with this.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\nAnd your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:4, 6, 18 David knew this.\n‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought.\n‚Äï 1 Chronicles 28:9a Every plan. Every thought. And the intent behind each and every thought. Every motive which wanted to remain hidden is in fact fully exposed to the Lord who searches all hearts.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nDo you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?\n‚Äï Romans 6:16 Holding fast Jesus\u0026rsquo; name is in truth all about consistency and integrity in the secret heart. Do you realise your character is the product of a thousand seemingly insignificant choices? You simply cannot do one thing and become another.\nIf then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\nAnd whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:1-4, 17 O my soul, you must also take heed of Jesus\u0026rsquo; sharp two-edged sword.\nFor the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.\n‚Äï Hebrews 4:12-13 Finally, notice that Antipas chose martyrdom rather than deny Jesus. And his reward? To bear the same description as of Jesus himself!\nGrace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.\n‚Äï Revelation 1:4-5 Jesus is the faithful witness and he bestowed upon Antipas the very same title.\nO my soul, be ruthlessly consistent in how you approach all these apparently small things, and be Jesus\u0026rsquo; faithful witness in everything! üôè\n","date":"2024-09-10T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/small-victories/robert-collins-tvc5imO5pXk-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3471013_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/small-victories/","title":"Small victories?"},{"content":"O my soul,\nDo you love your life?\nMany do.

Let\u0026rsquo;s first notice how much the currency of heaven differs from that of the world. These faithful ones in Smyrna were suffering and impoverished and slandered, and yet regarded by Jesus as rich. Rejoice that the currency of heaven is not that of the world!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also notice that they were slandered by those falsely claiming to be Jews. Slander is speech which is injurious to another\u0026rsquo;s good name. Jesus stands with and commends these slandered ones. And their accusers? A synagogue of Satan! Can you imagine a clearer or harsher or more final judgment? As in Ephesus, those seeming to hold and wield power were utterly rejected by him.\nWhat could these faithful ones in Smyrna expect to receive for their patient endurance?\n‚ÄòDo not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.‚Äô\n‚Äï Revelation 2:10 Suffering. Prison. Even greater tribulation. And for some, death.\nAnd this is a test! This time the test is not to endure years of waiting. This is a crisis time distilled into ten days, but let us not underestimate the severity of such testing.\nThe writer to the Hebrews tells us what was similarly faced by others so highly commended for their faith.\nSome were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword.\n‚Äï Hebrews 11:35-37 Is this the reward for faithfulness and patient endurance? By no means! The actual reward is clearly stated.\n‚ÄúBe faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:10b O my soul, have you noticed that for each of the letters to the seven churches, Jesus introduces himself differently, and for each so pertinently to the situation found there.\n‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‚ÄòThe words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:8 Isn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus reminding those about to face death that that is not the end?

And what is he most concerned about? That he will not be ashamed, that his courage will withstand, and that Christ may be honoured in his body, whether by life or by death!\nHow is this possible? He knew about that crown of life.\nFor to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:21-24 There is no death wish here, simply a crystal clear understanding of the joys that lie ahead in the heavenly realms. To die is gain, of course it is. To depart and be with Christ is far better. This must be fully understood! Observe and savour Paul\u0026rsquo;s peace and lightness of spirit, that he is able to quip about choosing as if the choice were his own! And through the prayers of the Philippian Christians and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ he knows that this will turn out for his deliverance.\nO my soul, do not neglect to pray for those facing such trials, that they may know the same, and know too that this is not something worth being anxious about.\nAnd which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?‚Å†\n‚Äï Luke 12:25 And Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also.

And what must remain the most important thing even when confronted by unbearable evil?\nTo answer this let\u0026rsquo;s examine both Jesus\u0026rsquo; commendation and his rebuke of the church in Ephesus.\n‚ÄúTo the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.\n‚Äú‚ÄòI know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name\u0026rsquo;s sake, and you have not grown weary.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 2:1-3 These are the words of the risen Lord Jesus, who holds the angels of the seven churches in his right hand, who walks among the seven churches, and whose name is Faithful and True. Praise him!\nFirstly let\u0026rsquo;s notice the patient endurance which is so highly commended, and the toil. Enduring patiently is hard work! It is heart work. These Ephesian Christians were enduring patiently and not growing weary. How they must have been fixing their eyes on Jesus!\nTherefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,‚ÄØlooking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.\nConsider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:1-3 O my soul, do you notice an absolutely vital element of patient endurance here? It is personal holiness. Let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely. A life beset by sin saps endurance and loses the race. A holy life endures and wins the race. Choose to live a holy life!\nNow endurance is only so in the face of adversity. So what was the adversity in Ephesus? We are told immediately. There was a clear and present evil, namely those who called themselves apostles and were not.\nWhat can be said about those self-proclaimed and false apostles? They were surely found among the Ephesian church, because otherwise what testing would have been required, and what would these patient and enduring ones have had to bear? These patient ones so highly commended by Jesus? But at the same time, those false apostles did not belong to the church. Strikingly, this letter to the church is not addressed to them. They are third parties, judged by Jesus himself to be inconsequential and irrelevant. There is no call for their repentance. They are simply not part of his church. O my soul, tremble at this complete and comprehensive rejection.\nWe can wonder at the impact they were having on the Ephesian church. It was likely profound. But Jesus\u0026rsquo; focus is on those he calls his own, whom he commends for enduring patiently and bearing up for his name\u0026rsquo;s sake‚∏∫for Jesus\u0026rsquo; name\u0026rsquo;s sake‚∏∫for the sake of all he is and all he has done. This is why they endure.\nAnd quite remarkably, they have not grown weary. O my soul, think on that. How wearisome would be this opposition and yet their strength remains. Praise the Lord for his strengthening under such adversarial circumstances!\nAnd yet these very ones commended for their patient endurance are at the same time rebuked by the Lord. Why is that?\n‚ÄúBut I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.\u0026quot;\n‚Äï Revelation 2:4-5 The rebuke is for lack of love, abandonment even, of the very most important thing.\nAnd one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, ‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe most important is, ‚ÄòHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 12:28-31 There is indeed no other commandment greater than these. Not only does love conquer all, but it must be ahead of all.\nThese who patiently endured had once loved with Jesus\u0026rsquo; own love, but they had fallen away from this. And notice Jesus\u0026rsquo; exhortation that they do the works they did at first. Love is such a practical thing. It is something to be done. Both love for the Lord and love for one another are evidenced by works.\nBe careful here. Some are rather eager to ask, what does that look like? But that is entirely the wrong question. How so? It is vital that this be understood.\nWhat is required is love‚∏∫our own love response to that great Calvary love poured out. Who can say what action might result from that? But one thing is clear. It is the love that counts. The action is merely evidence of that love. Aping this is of little value. Action without love is hollow.\nAnd notice this.\nWhat good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\nBut someone will say, ‚ÄúYou have faith and I have works.‚Äù Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\n‚Äï James 2:14-18 As with faith so with love. It is seen by works but those works cannot substitute for love.\nAnd we must not neglect to notice just how much is at stake here. Here is a wake-up call for those whose love is mediocre.\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.\n‚Äï Revelation 2:7 The conquering here is relearning to love‚∏∫there was no other rebuke. And we know what this tree of life is.\nThen the LORD God said, ‚ÄúBehold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever‚Äî‚Äù therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.\n‚Äï Genesis 3:22-24 The fruit of the tree of life is well guarded, kept for the one who conquers. O my soul, think about that love you had at first. That great Calvary love, poured out for you. And be that one.\nBy this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.\n‚Äï 1 John 3:16 We love because he first loved us.\n‚Äï 1 John 4:19 O my soul, love again with that love you had at first, that great Calvary love poured out for you!üôè\n","date":"2024-08-27T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/enduring-in-love/mahmoud-sulaiman-aO9nGw9Cbk0-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_3395044_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/enduring-in-love/","title":"Enduring in love"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is the hardest thing?\nI mean, what is the hardest thing to endure? That which leads you to think you have been forgotten by the Lord and he has withdrawn himself? That which is the loneliest path to walk? That which keeps you in sorrow throughout the day? That which makes you cry out with that most earnest and desperate question, how long, O Lord?\nIs it not waiting?\nHow long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?\n‚Äï Psalm 13:1-2 Does not that waiting time seem like death or defeat?\nConsider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, lest my enemy say, ‚ÄúI have prevailed over him,‚Äù lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:3-4 That waiting time can be unspeakably awful, seemingly almost too hard to bear. And isn\u0026rsquo;t it all such a terrible waste of time?\nBy no means!\nWe have to notice something. O my soul, you must notice quite how much waiting is done by those in whom and through whom the Lord does great works.\nMoses waited for forty years. In the wilderness. Tending sheep.\nJoseph waited for more than ten. In prison. Apparently forgotten.\nJesus himself waited thirty years. In obscurity.\nCould it be that somehow the waiting time is when the Lord does his most important work of preparation?\nRecall what happened at the end of Moses\u0026rsquo; waiting time, his forty years in the wilderness of Midian, that apparently wasted time.\nThen the LORD said, ‚ÄúI have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n‚ÄúCome, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 3:7-8, 10 Finally Moses was ready to be used by the Lord for this great task. How do we know that?\nBut Moses said to God, ‚ÄúWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 3:11 Moses had become nothing. He had died to self. It had taken forty years, because there had previously been so much pride in his heart. He had previously been so full of Moses, so pleased with himself. And now he regarded himself as nothing at all. But he wasn\u0026rsquo;t. He was finally ready to be used greatly by the Lord. And he was.\nAnd Joseph? After more than ten years in prison, he had to wait yet another seven before the Lord used him to rescue the people of Israel from famine in the land of Canaan. What was his testimony then?\nBefore the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. ‚ÄúFor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúGod has made me forget all my hardship and all my father\u0026rsquo;s house.‚Äù The name of the second he called Ephraim, ‚ÄúFor God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Äï Genesis 41:50-52 O my soul, praise the Lord for his faithfulness to Joseph, and rest in that same faithfulness. He knows precisely what he is doing, and all his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness. He takes the years that are required, and those years are not wasted. Rather they are the time of preparation and meticulous restoration and transforming grace.\nDo you know how a diamond is formed? Under intense pressure and heat and a billion years of waiting. Are those wasted years?\nAnd Jesus? Even as a twelve year old he displayed such understanding. Do you not think he would have wanted to heal the sick and the brokenhearted and rescue the lost when he was seventeen? When he was twenty-three? When he was twenty-eight?\nO my soul, in your own waiting time know that Jesus understands.\nSince then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\n‚Äï Hebrews 4:14-16 What is the greatest temptation in the waiting time? Is it not to doubt the goodness and faithfulness and sufficiency of God? Repent of those doubts and trust the Lord!\nAnd did you notice that question which was asked four times by the psalmist and still not answered? How long O Lord? How long? This is the most unanswered question, and painfully so. But what is the psalmist really asking for?\nConsider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:3 It is not really an answer to his question that the psalmist is seeking. It is the answer which is the presence and compassion and adequacy and rescue of God.\nAnd notice too how this answer is received.\nBut I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:5 O my soul, in your own waiting time you must trust in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s steadfast love. And here is trust. It is to assert and to dwell in the wisdom and kindness and faithfulness and sufficiency of the Lord right in the middle of that painful longing. Right there in the middle of the waiting is the only opportunity to trust. So do that, and rejoice in his salvation!\nAnd what then?\nI will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.\n‚Äï Psalm 13:6 O my soul, sing to the Lord, because he has already dealt bountifully with you! üôè\n","date":"2024-08-20T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/blessed-in-the-waiting/49820769116_8868b8d012_o_hu5ebaa96a626c1503a358f8fac938b96b_1650343_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/blessed-in-the-waiting/","title":"Blessed in the waiting"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat are those years the locusts have eaten?\nI will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Joel 2:25a Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this sound like a wonderful promise of restoration? But what does it mean? To understand those years we must first understand the locusts. So what are the locusts? I have quoted only half a verse.\nI will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.\n‚Äï Joel 2:25 These are the words of the Lord, and so these are his own locusts, his great army, which he sent.\nThe word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:\nHear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land!

What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.\n‚Äï Joel 1:1-4 Whatever is going on here clearly was and is of vital importance and must be remembered. Notice the urgent exhortation to pay attention, to tell the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, not to forget even through the generations. We ourselves must not overlook this. It is as relevant today as it was then.\nWe learn more from Zephaniah.\n‚ÄúI will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,‚Äù declares the LORD. ‚ÄúI will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the rubble with the wicked.

And this is a prophecy of the day of the Lord, that terrible day of judgment and destruction rained down by the Lord on his own people, his beloved ones.\nBut why? Why would this happen?\n‚ÄúI will punish the officials and the king\u0026rsquo;s sons and all who array themselves in foreign attire.‚Äù\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:8 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s people, his highest and most exalted ones, had become so compromised, so contaminated by the nations. So worldly. So like us in fact.\n‚ÄúAt that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are complacent, those who say in their hearts, ‚ÄòThe LORD will not do good, nor will he do ill.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:12 O my soul, do you think this couldn\u0026rsquo;t happen to us? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that thought the very definition of complacency? That the Lord will not do good, nor will he do ill? That everything will just continue to tick along as we all go about our lives? That the extent of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s interest is merely to observe? O my soul, repudiate such thinking. Purge that complacency.\nWhat then should be done in the face of this day of judgment?\nBe silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:7a Are you so full of bluster? So full of excuses? So full of self-justification? Be silent! Be silent before the Lord God!\nAnd then what?\nSeek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his just commands; seek righteousness; seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the anger of the LORD.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 2:3 We must be silent and humble ourselves and seek righteousness and humility. But where may these be found in the midst of all this negligence and self-indulgence and intransigence?\nJohn tells us of the first.\nMy little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\n‚Äï 1 John 2:1-2 And Paul tells us of the second.\nHave this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:5-8 Seek righteousness and humility. Seek Jesus. Cry out to him for salvation and turn to him so that you may be hidden on that terrible day of the Lord.\nFor you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n‚Äï Colossians 3:3 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:28-29 Let us repent of complacency and brainless triumphalism, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s something else to notice here.\nBe silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 1:7 The Lord has indeed prepared a sacrifice.\nAnd Isaac said to his father Abraham, ‚ÄúMy father!‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúHere I am, my son.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúBehold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?‚Äù Abraham said, ‚ÄúGod will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 22:7-8 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n‚Äï Hebrews 9:24-26 Not only has the Lord prepared the sacrifice of his only Son at such enormous cost, but through him he has also consecrated his guests. O my soul, your own consecration is ongoing, as you are so very aware. Rejoice that it continues and exult with all your heart at the lavish generosity of this restoration.\nSing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; he has cleared away your enemies.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 3:14-15 And observe how the Lord himself rejoices to see his people returning to him in repentance and humility.\nThe LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.\n‚Äï Zephaniah 3:17 O my soul, be quieted by that great Calvary love, rejoice and give thanks to the one who restores those years! üôè\n","date":"2024-08-13T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/locusts/Exodus_10_hu9f2b42aac2c7717a325a8f9891a066b0_33298_120x120_fill_q75_h2_box_smart1_2.webp","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/locusts/","title":"Locusts"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat is this answer that the psalmist received when he told the Lord of his ways?\nWhen I told of my ways, you answered me; teach me your statutes!\n‚Äï Psalm 119:26 And why is this followed by an immediate and urgent plea to be taught his statutes?\nAnd what even was the question that demanded an answer? Do you see a question here from the psalmist?\nCould it be that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer is not so much an answer to a question but something far deeper?\nWe find something similar in the previous psalm.\nOut of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:5 Calling on the Lord is no sort of question. This is a cry for help. So what is the answer?\nJoel tells of an answer of a similar kind. In the context of the day of the Lord, that fearful day of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s righteous judgment of his own wayward people, that day of destruction, that day of reckoning, we find this.\nThen the LORD became jealous for his land and had pity on his people. The LORD answered and said to his people, ‚ÄúBehold, I am sending to you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.\n‚Äï Joel 2:18-19 There is only one question in sight here, and it is found in the prayer of the ministers of the Lord.\nSpare your people, O LORD, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations.

The turning point comes next and it is this.\nI have chosen the way of faithfulness.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:30a This is the turning point. In weakness and in sorrow, clinging on in the dust, with courage and determination the psalmist chooses the way of faithfulness. Everything follows from this. O my soul, choose the way of faithfulness!\nBut what exactly is this way of faithfulness?\nFirstly, let\u0026rsquo;s be clear about whose faithfulness this is. Recall the Lord\u0026rsquo;s introduction of himself to Moses.\nMoses said to the LORD, ‚ÄúSee, you say to me, ‚ÄòBring up this people,‚Äô but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‚ÄòI know you by name, and you have also found favour in my sight.‚Äô Now therefore, if I have found favour in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favour in your sight.‚Äù\nMoses said, ‚ÄúPlease show me your glory.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 33:12-13, 18 The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:5-7 This is the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\nThis way of faithfulness is the way of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness. So what does it mean to choose this way?\nDavid knew.\nVindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Psalm 26:1-3 To choose the way of faithfulness and to walk in it is to trust in the Lord without wavering. It is to rely on him whatever else is happening, reminding oneself of his steadfast love. Prove me, O Lord, and try me. Know that I do not doubt you. I do not doubt your goodness and your mercy.\nO my soul, what do you suppose is this proving? This trying? This testing?\nIt is to see beyond current circumstances with eyes of faith, beyond current suffering, to assert with the psalmist out of the darkest valley, out of the deepest sorrow, out of the most wrenching pain:\nI know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:75 It is to assert confidence in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness and to wait upon him, trusting and not doubting. Beyond the point of understanding, beyond the point of being able to see is where trust is tried, tested, and proven. And in this time of testing, this waiting time, it is to walk in one\u0026rsquo;s integrity, keeping covenant with the Holy One, surrendering all to him as an act of worship, perhaps in tears and bewilderment, but surrendering nonetheless.\nAnd what must one do while walking in this way of faithfulness?\nI set your rules before me.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:30b When your heart is breaking, set his rules before you and walk in them, and know this:\nAll the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.\n‚Äï Psalm 25:10 O my soul, be sure to keep his covenant and his testimonies!\nAnd now what about that future tense of the running?\nI will run in the way of your commandments when you enlarge my heart!\n‚Äï Psalm 119:32 My heart is breaking and I simply lack the capacity for this. How can I endure this waiting time? My strength is almost gone. But the Lord himself enlarges my heart.\nThese sterile and barren bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance. That is why waiting does not diminish us, any more than waiting diminishes a pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the waiting. We, of course, don‚Äôt see what is enlarging us. But the longer we wait, the larger we become, and the more joyful our expectancy.\n‚Äï Romans 8:23-25 MSG I will run, O my soul, I will! I will run in the way of his commandments, trusting and not doubting. I choose the way of faithfulness. I choose to trust the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nO my soul, trust in the Lord with all your heart and choose the way of his steadfast love and faithfulness! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-30T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-turning-point/_hu2592a06bfa7b450531f084cfe1250709_2656986_a1cd222c21e60a940f8c3700b2039fff.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-turning-point/","title":"The turning point"},{"content":"O my soul,\nHave you given much thought to what is pure?\nFinally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:8 What is pure then?\nThe words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.\n‚Äï Psalm 12:6 This psalm underlines the striking contrast between the purity of the Lord and his words and the double-mindedness of humankind.\nEveryone utters lies to his neighbour; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.\n‚Äï Psalm 12:2 The words of the Lord then are pure, but what else? Is the catalogue of what is pure in fact a very short list indeed? Could we add to that list? What else could be pure?\nJesus said:\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n‚Äï Matthew 5:8 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this one beatitude stand out from among the others as utterly intimidating? Being poor in spirit, mourning, meekness, hunger and thirsting for righteousness, being merciful‚∏∫isn\u0026rsquo;t our response to those others, yes Lord? But being pure in heart? Isn\u0026rsquo;t our response to this, O Lord have mercy on me, a sinner? Yes of course it is, at least it is if we have any honesty in our own self-evaluation. And that is because it seems to be utterly beyond us. But is it? Is it really? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this, and as we do, give thought to the prize.\nO my soul, do you want to see God? Then resolve to do this, to be pure in heart. But how? How can we?\nJob\u0026rsquo;s friend Eliphaz uttered much foolishness in his earnest desire to help Job. Here\u0026rsquo;s some of it.\nCan mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?\n‚Äï Job 4:17 He followed up with two rhetorical questions, revealing the limitations of his own understanding.\nWhat is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?\n‚Äï Job 15:14 He was wrong, O my soul. Rejoice that he was wrong.\nThe LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ‚ÄúMy anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.\n‚Äï Job 42:7b Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to answer the question by understanding how. How is it possible to be pure before the Lord? There are three elements which must come together.\nThe first is this.\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 Cleanse means purify. Jesus came and died for you and for me and for all of humankind, that we may be forgiven our sin, that we may be justified and redeemed, and that we may be purified from all unrighteousness. The justification and redemption were an immediate and once-and-for-all-time thing. The purification is a rest-of-our-life thing and is the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. Without the body and blood of Jesus there can be no meaningful purification, so perhaps Eliphaz was not entirely wrong.\nThis is the first and most fundamental element of purification.\nThe psalmist points us to the second.\nHow can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:9-11 I love this. I am that young man, so desiring to keep my way pure and yet so aware of the challenge in that, and so aware of my own propensity to sin‚∏∫so aware of how I fall short, and therefore so resolute in guarding my heart according to the revealed word of God. And seeking him will take my whole heart, but it will be so worth it.\nYou will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD.\n‚Äï Jeremiah 29:13-14a With all my heart I will seek the Lord, ruthlessly and unrelentingly. No holding back. No compromise. No distractions. My heart-cry is, let me not wander from your commandments!\nO my soul, do you understand what it means to store up his word in your heart? Immerse yourself in the Bible. It is his precious gift to us. Read it. Savour it. Chew on it. Digest it. Commit it to memory. And do it. It will guard your heart.\nThis is the second element of purification.\nAnd the third? The third element is surprising and inclined to be overlooked in this regard, but it is in fact the game-changer, the red pill.\nAnd it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:9-11 The third element is the extraordinary power of love, both the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great love which came first, and our love response to his rescue‚∏∫our love for the Lord and our love for one another. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this simply astonishing? That the outworking of authentic and abounding love could be a pure heart? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this.\nThis fruit of righteousness comes through Jesus Christ, and is to the glory and praise of God. It is his own work in us, and it is all of grace.\nFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:8-9 We love because he first loved us.\n‚Äï 1 John 4:19 This is love from a grateful heart. But how can purity be the result of this love? Didn\u0026rsquo;t the Pharisees expend so much energy dotting every i and crossing every t in order to become pure? And there are so many commandments to keep. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it all utterly wearying, completely beyond us? By no means!\nOwe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.\nLove is the fulfilling of the law.\n‚Äï Romans 13:8, 10b Love is the fulfilling of the law, and surely this is purity before the Lord. A pure heart then is the outworking of authentic and abounding love.\nWho can say, ‚ÄúI have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin?‚Äù\n‚Äï Proverbs 20:9 O my soul, know that this is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will for you, so receive it and embrace it and pursue it with your whole heart! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-23T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/a-pure-heart/bas-glaap-DEQS0GFk4AM-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_6319224_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/a-pure-heart/","title":"A pure heart"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat are you thinking about?\nAre you thinking again about those insolent ones?

Think about how to do this in his Spirit and by his power.\nThink about what is worthy of praise.\nThen I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!‚Äù\n‚Äï Revelation 5:11-12 Hear the sound of a hundred million angels singing praise to the risen Lord Jesus in his resurrection power and splendour.

His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.\nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.

Narrowly escaping death at their hands he was sold into slavery at the age of seventeen and then thrown into prison in Egypt for a crime he didn\u0026rsquo;t commit, where he was incarcerated for more than ten years.\nIs this what God had intended for him? Why had this all happened? Is this what the Lord\u0026rsquo;s perfect plans and purposes look like for those he loves?\nBy no means! We simply must account for human folly and foolishness. Joseph\u0026rsquo;s own life and his whole family were dominated by these.\nNow Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colours. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:3-4 Jacob, now called Israel, fathered Joseph in his old age and doted upon him, unwisely favouring him above his brothers whose subsequent envy grew to become hatred.\nAnd Joseph demonstrated that he was his father\u0026rsquo;s son through his own lack of wisdom.\nJoseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father\u0026rsquo;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:2 At seventeen shouldn\u0026rsquo;t he have known better how to get on with his brothers than telling tales about them to their own father?\nNow Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. He said to them, ‚ÄúHear this dream that I have dreamed: Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.‚Äù His brothers said to him, ‚ÄúAre you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?‚Äù So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.\n‚Äï Genesis 37:5-8 Joseph\u0026rsquo;s dream was from the Lord and revealed a glorious future. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to that. But this revelation caused his brothers to hate him even more. They hated him even more because he was unwise enough to tell them of that prophecy which did indeed come to pass, eventually. Nevertheless, sharing it with his brothers as he did was both foolish and inflammatory. He was his father\u0026rsquo;s son.\nAnd this was a mistake he repeated.\nThen he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, ‚ÄúBehold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 37:9 Perhaps such things are better kept to one\u0026rsquo;s self.\nLater when he arrived in Egypt as a slave he was equally naive. Let\u0026rsquo;s first notice how this foreign slave without credentials or experience became the trusted overseer of the household of Potiphar, the captain of the guard of the Pharaoh of Egypt.\nThe LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master. His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:2-3 Wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blessing from the Lord all entirely undeserved? Grace and favour were raining down from heaven on this naive young man.\nAnd then he was accused by Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife of attempted rape. But notice again the pattern here. Just as Joseph had been unwise to share that dream with his brothers, so also he was unwise to be in the house alone with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife.\nNow Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. And after a time his master\u0026rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, ‚ÄúLie with me.‚Äù But he refused \u0026hellip;\nAnd as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:6-8, 10 And so it continued day after day. His woeful encounter with Potiphar\u0026rsquo;s wife was not an isolated incident.\nAs soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, ‚ÄúThis is the way your servant treated me,‚Äù his anger was kindled. And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king\u0026rsquo;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:19-20 Joseph again got what he deserved for his own foolishness, didn\u0026rsquo;t he? But what do we find, again?\nBut the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:21 The undeserved steadfast love of the Lord continued to rain down upon him.\nAnd whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.\n‚Äï Genesis 39:23 Eventually‚∏∫and never was a word so appropriate as here in Joseph\u0026rsquo;s life‚∏∫eventually, Joseph came before Pharaoh himself, in a way which was indeed by the hand of the Lord, interpreted his dream, and was freed to a great and glorious future.\nThen Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSince God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.‚Äù And Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‚ÄúSee, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 41:39-41 How ironic. Through those long years of incarceration God had transformed that foolish youth into a man so discerning and wise. What a miracle of grace. Praise the Lord!\nO my soul, you know the rest. Famine in Canaan caused Jacob to send his sons to Egypt to buy food. After some scheming by Joseph which we could see as teaching his brothers a lesson (and who could blame him for that?) there was an emotional reconciliation. And then what?\nThus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.\n‚Äï Genesis 47:27 What is this story all about then? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s incredible rescue of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s family from famine in their own land? Yes, certainly it is that. A family reconciliation after separation caused by hatred and betrayal? Yes, that too. Rescue and restoration of a naive young man from the consequences of his own foolishness? Indeed.\nBut ultimately isn\u0026rsquo;t this in fact all about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for undeserving sinners? A Plan B so good and full of grace it seems to improve upon that hypothetical Plan A which never transpired. This Plan B which was wrought out of folly and foolishness and disappointment and shame.\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 So much had gone wrong, but none of this pain and heartbreak and suffering was intended by the Lord nor attributable to him.\nAnd so it is with us. He is the great rescuer, fully able to pick up the pieces of ruined lives and work all things together for good. His plans and purposes are not thwarted by our mistakes nor by our foolishness. Praise the Lord! And throughout Joseph\u0026rsquo;s story never once did God\u0026rsquo;s grace and steadfast love and faithfulness reach its limit. His grace is sufficient. Yes, the rescue took its time, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t it so well worth the wait?\nRejoice, O my soul, in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s glorious Plan B for your own ruined life! üôè\n","date":"2024-07-09T06:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/senjuti-kundu-JfolIjRnveY-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1444207_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/plan-b/","title":"Plan B"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWould you build a dam across the river of living water?

Would you?\nO my soul, know that I do understand why you would want to build your dam. I acknowledge that you have been treated heinously and that you have been brushed aside and disregarded. And I know that you\u0026rsquo;re hurting, really hurting, and from time to time you want to assert that nobody cares.

For sure, there are some who don\u0026rsquo;t, perhaps several, and others who are only pretending. But there remain those who are loving and kind and faithful and true.

Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‚ÄòOut of his heart will flow rivers of living water.‚Äô‚Äù Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n‚Äï John 7:37-39 O my soul, do you thirst?

Extend love and kindness to those who do not, and it will be measured back to you, O my soul, how it will! And rivers of living water will flow out of your heart and you will be a blessing to many.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t the way these insolent ones carry on simply egregious? Yes of course it is, and appallingly so. What\u0026rsquo;s to be done then about their heinous behaviour?\nBe angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\n‚Äï Psalm 4:4-5 Be angry, O my soul. Be angry and do not sin. Notice it is ‚Äúand‚Äù not ‚Äúbut‚Äù. Interesting! The dam on the river is not made of anger. Was Jesus angry when he cleared the temple? Yes of course he was and rightly so. There is a righteous anger and it is of the Lord. Be angry and do not sin. The behaviour is egregious and it cannot be excused. It can only be forgiven, and this you must do.\nAnd listen to the heart-cry of the Psalmist to the Lord. Make it your own as you put your trust in the Lord.\nDeal bountifully with your servant, that I may live and keep your word. Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.\nYou rebuke the insolent, accursed ones, who wander from your commandments. Take away from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:17-18, 21-22 The Lord himself is the one who rebukes these insolent ones. And there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nThe word of the LORD came to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.\nThus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:1-3,10 And there is good news indeed for these poor sheep.\nI myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:15-16 But beware, O my soul, there is a warning also to these very same sheep.\nIs it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?\nI will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.\n‚Äï Ezekiel 34:18,22 What then are we to do? Two things:\nForgive, and you will be forgiven.\n‚Äï Luke 6:37 and:\nIf you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday. And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.\n‚Äï Isaiah 58:10-11 You must do what those insolent ones will not, and then you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water.

No wavering. No second guessing. None at all.\nJesus said \u0026hellip; ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 5:36 Such trust is life and health and strength. Why would anyone not live like this? And yet many do not.\nRecall with me the sorry saga of the Israelites failing to trust the Lord, their ongoing enslavement to fear and uncertainty and doubt. And recall too the Lord\u0026rsquo;s uncompromising response, his righteous anger burning against them, his chosen people, his beloved ones.\nWhat reason did the Israelites have to trust the Lord?\nIn the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:12-16 This is the God who miraculously delivered his people from slavery in Egypt, parting the waters of the Red Sea so they could pass safely. And led them through the desert, miraculously guiding them and remaining with them. And slaked their thirst in the desert, again, miraculously.\nAnd he fed them with manna from heaven.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day\u0026rsquo;s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 16:4 Here was the test. This is the trust test. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that the Israelites faced time and again. It\u0026rsquo;s the test that we ourselves face time and again.\nAnd how did they do, those Israelites, those chosen people, those beloved ones?\nThey forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:11 They forgot all the reasons they had to trust him! Their earlier fear of the Lord and belief in him was so feeble it had simply evaporated like the morning mist.\nBut it gets worse.\nYet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. They spoke against God, saying, ‚ÄúCan God spread a table in the wilderness? He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 78:17-20 Can you hear the sneering doubt here, the sheer contempt for their provider, the complete absence of trust? O my soul, be appalled.\nTherefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:21-22 Paul explains.\nFor I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:1-5 They drank from the Rock which was Christ no less and yet they failed the trust test. Overthrown means struck down. In judgment for their lack of trust most of them were struck down by the Lord, their hitherto protector and provider, the Faithful One. Most of them!\nThe anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:31 Why did this happen?\nBecause they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.\n‚Äï Psalm 78:22 This is how important it is to trust, to believe, to depend upon the Lord without wavering.\nAnd what of our own trust test?\nO my soul, even when things are very dark indeed you must trust the Lord and depend upon him relentlessly. He is faithful and true. Never doubt that!\nWho among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.\n‚Äï Isaiah 50:10 Trust is tested when our lives are at stake, when our hearts are breaking, when things are entirely beyond us and all we can do is depend upon the Lord, upon his faithfulness to all that he has promised and to all that he is, when the way ahead is unseeable. But without the unseeable there can be no faith! O my soul, will you trust him then? Will you trust him now? Will you continue to trust him?\nNow hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.\n‚Äï Romans 8:24-25 O my soul, in this waiting time of unseeing are you tempted to doubt? Are you tempted to despair? Are you tempted to run ahead of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will in your own strength? Resist! You must resist! Hold on to what is true. Hold on to the one whose name is Faithful and True.\nNo temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:13 You can endure this, O my soul. Repudiate doubt and all that drags you down, and trust him. Trust him! You must endure with steadfast faith, believing and not doubting. Trust Jesus, whose name is Faithful and True!\nThe penalty for failing the truth test is severe, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen. For standing firm, however, there are two stupendous prizes.\nFirstly,\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 Trust in him, O my soul, and he will act!\nAnd secondly,\nThe LORD‚Äôs delight is in those who fear him, those who put their hope in his unfailing love.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:11 NLT By doing this, by walking this path of trust and dependence and unwavering hope in him, waiting with patience, you can delight our Heavenly Father. You can delight him! What more motivation could you have to choose to trust?\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.\n‚Äï Romans 15:13 O my soul, put all your hope in his unfailing love and trust in the faithfulness of your Heavenly Father, and so delight him! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2024-06-25T06:30:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/the-trust-test/guzman-barquin-Qd688l1yDOI-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_538455_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/the-trust-test/","title":"The trust test"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhy are you here?\nI mean, why do you exist?

Before we come to my question though, let\u0026rsquo;s consider how the Lord regards us, his beloved ones. Let\u0026rsquo;s lose ourselves in the love letter which is Isaiah Chapter 43.\nBut now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: ‚ÄúFear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:1 Remember Jacob? He was that despicable little man, that man entirely without honour, a liar and a cheat. The man who wrestled with God, all night. The man to whom God gave a new name, Israel.\nSo these words addressed to Jacob, who are they for? Their setting was the Babylonian exile. Jacob had been dead for perhaps a thousand years. Not for him then! These words are for his descendants‚∏∫not his physical descendants, but the children of the promise‚∏∫and that includes us!\nO my soul, these words are spoken to you by the God who created you, who formed you, who continues to form you‚∏∫and he is not done with the forming by any means!\nAnd I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:6 Paul continues.\nAnd it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.\n‚Äï Philippians 1:9-11 So that you may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness. Fear not, O my soul. You have been redeemed by the Creator God of the universe. Called by him. Known by him. Belonging to him. Rejoice in that ineffable truth and embrace the forming of purity and blamelessness in your own life!\nKnow this: you are called by name. Your name is who you are. It is your character. You are fully known by the one who calls. There is nothing that the Lord could subsequently learn about you which would change how he regards you. You are called and you are known and you are his.\nDo you remember God\u0026rsquo;s question to Jacob after the wrestling?\nAnd he said to him, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúJacob.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 32:27 What is God asking here? He is the omniscient and all powerful Creator God of the universe and he asks, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù He is not seeking information! The question to Jacob is, what kind of man are you? And Jacob confesses his name‚∏∫the cheat, the deceiver, vile and despicable.\nThen he said, ‚ÄúYour name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel.\n‚Äï Genesis 32:28 Behold! God is the one who makes all things new! Praise him!\nAnd marvel at the extent to which the Lord will go to do this. Isaiah continues.\nFor I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour. I give Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in exchange for you. Because you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:3-4 He is my saviour. He is your saviour. The ransom is costly and there is no limit to where he will go for the rescue, because I am precious in his eyes, and honoured. Because you are precious, and he loves you.\n‚ÄúI give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.‚Äù\nO my soul, he gave one man in particular in return for you: Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, in exchange for your life. In exchange for mine.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\n‚Äï John 3:16 The ransom is costly. But fear not, O my soul, he has redeemed you!\nSo why are you here? Why do you exist? What were you created for?\nBut now thus says the LORD\nBecause you are precious in my eyes, and honoured, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.\n\u0026hellip; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:1, 4, 6-7 You were created for the glory of God. He set his love upon you, called you by name, poured out that great love at Calvary, and redeemed you. There is no higher calling than for the glory of God. It is why I am here. It is why you are here. And as we receive that great Calvary love may all see it for what it is and give God the glory due his name.

Do you want to receive what has been promised from the one whose name is Faithful and True? Then you have need of endurance!\nThis endurance is what will enable you to do the will of God, and to keep on doing it.

This is what it means to endure. Believe in Jesus, the one whom the Lord has sent! Above all else this means trust him. Trust him, absolutely and completely, and depend upon him, and on him alone.\nTrust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.\n‚Äï Proverbs 3:5-6 My own understanding is quite simply not up to the task. This is entirely beyond me. O my soul, at that point beyond which you cannot understand what or why or how, you must surrender your need to understand, and simply trust the one who does‚∏∫the one whose name is Faithful and True.

You can continue, O my soul, so do that!\nAnd as you resolve to continue to take this path ahead, wondering whether you have the strength even for that, you must understand where strength comes from. It comes from hope. Hold on to hope. The one who promised is Faithful and True. Rejoice in that hope!\nRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\n‚Äï Romans 12:12 Strength comes from hope.

Were you expecting great things? And are you tempted to say, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù? That nothing happened? (You would be so very wrong about that, by the way.)\nAnd if you think that nothing happened yesterday, now what? What will you do now? Where is hope? How can hope survive the passing of yet another day, the unrelenting accumulation of which become inexorable years? How can faith survive this, O my soul? How will this rollercoaster of expectation and disappointment not simply grind you down into the dust?\nHow indeed?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how. There are three reasons. The first reason is to understand that disappointment is a lie.\nDisappointment is a lie because it presupposes failure. But what failure would that be, exactly?\nListen to Joshua, now old and well advanced in years, passing on some wisdom at the end of his own life to those who would come after him.\nAnd now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.\n‚Äï Joshua 23:14 Not one of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promises had failed, nor has failed, nor will fail. Know that he is faithful and true, O my soul, to all that he has said, and to all that he is!\nAnd if you think that what you were hoping for yesterday didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, what you were expecting, what you were so committed in faith to receiving, then listen to the Lord himself, speaking through Isaiah.\n‚ÄúI am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,‚Äô calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:9-11 For sure, there are things not yet done, but there is none like God, declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient times. O my soul, he will do it! He will accomplish all he has purposed! Know that nothing has failed. Trust him still and praise him!\nThe second reason is because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts. Poured out for you, O my soul.\nTherefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,‚ÄØand hope does not put us to shame, because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:1-5 I will have to return another time to rejoicing in our sufferings but for now consider just that final verse, for which the Berean Standard Bible rendition is particularly helpful.\nAnd hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:5 BSB Hope does not disappoint. God himself is both the giver and the one who pours. It is his own great love. He poured out that same love at Calvary, O my soul. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God!\nThe third and final reason is to understand at least something of what did actually happen yesterday.\nWhat was I hoping for? Isaiah knows.\nOh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:1 I was hoping that the Creator God of the Universe, awesome in power and terrifying in purity but also so very good and kind, would break into this impossible situation, breathing out grace and truth and power into my own life and those around me.\nSo did he?\nFrom of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:4 Isaiah tells us that the Lord acts. Not that he will act, or even that he did act, but that he acts, in the present tense. He is working right now with great power for those who wait for him. Will you be that, O my soul? Will you continue to be that?\nAnd what is it that he is doing?\nHabbakuk knows and it cannot be told. The Lord himself declares it.\n‚ÄúLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.‚Äù\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 Wonder and be astounded, O my soul, at what the Lord is already doing in your life, and renounce disappointment! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-04T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/istrfry-marcus-NX0WjgdQl58-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1794935_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/","title":"That was yesterday"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhen do you expect change will come?\nAfter so many years spent hoping and trusting, holding on to your promise from the Lord and yet still waiting, are you tempted to give up?\nOr do you still somehow expect that the Lord will act with great power to fulfil that promise? And when exactly do you expect that?\nThere is only one answer which honours the Lord and that is today. You must continue to expect it and you must expect it today! It is imperative that you do so. Your very faith depends upon it. Your life and health and strength depend upon it. How else could you live a life that honours him, other than in complete trust and dependence upon him, and other than in expectation of the imminent outworking of his great power in your life?\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23 He who promised is indeed faithful. His very name is Faithful and True (Rev 19:11).\nBut why is it quite so important to hold fast to this hope, this expectation of imminent fulfilment, without wavering?\nWe are in the midst of a spiritual battle and the fighting is fierce. To expect anything other than imminent fulfilment would open the door to doubt ‚∏∫that doubt which is so ready to creep in and steal away hope and joy and expectation. That doubt which would cause all to unravel and expose the tattered remains of a faith which once was. That doubt which must be resisted with all strength. Be steadfast, O my soul! Cry out to the Faithful One, Lord I believe! Help my unbelief!\nSo Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. And Elijah came near to all the people and said, ‚ÄúHow long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.‚Äù And the people did not answer him a word.\nAnd they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, ‚ÄúO Baal, answer us!‚Äù But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‚ÄúCry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:20-21, 26-27 O my soul, are you tempted to such thoughts while you wait on the living God, the God of your life? Repudiate them!\nAnd at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, ‚ÄúO LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.‚Äù Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, ‚ÄúThe LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:36-39 The Lord, he is God! Praise him, O my soul!\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer to our most earnest praying, the outworking of his mighty strength in our lives to fulfil all that he has promised, is that all may know that the Lord, he is God! And his grace and kindness is that you, O my soul, may know it. Expect it today!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nOur experience of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power being outworked in our lives is limited only by our faith to believe it, our faith to receive it. This is why it is quite so important that we do not hold back in expectation.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30 O my soul, do you believe that he is able to do this? According to your faith be it done to you. Do not hold back in expectation!\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s yet more.\n‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 3:16-18 What do you dare to believe, O my soul, of the only Son of God. Do not hold back in expectation!\nThis is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:24 This is the day, O my soul!

Are you grieving for things that once were and are no longer? So was the psalmist.\nThese things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:4 Here is a man who used to live a life of affirmation and exaltation. But things changed and he became a pariah, even in his own church.\nAs with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:10 Or perhaps, O my soul, does the Lord seem to have withdrawn? Are you no longer enjoying that intimacy, the sweetness of his felt presence in your life? Nor was the psalmist. But the desire for that had not left him.\nMy soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:2-3 The multitude keeping festival, those privileged and self-satisfied ones, had closed ranks, and he was no longer among them. And it seemed to him that God himself had passed him by, forgotten him, rejected him. He was oppressed, scorned, and despised.\nIs there any hope? Is anything to be done?\nWhy are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation‚ÄØand my God.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:5-6, also v11 and Psalm 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? This is not a question in search of an answer. This is a rebuke. It is a rebuke delivered to one who has taken their eyes off the Lord, and has become overwhelmed by their own difficulties and disappointments, defeated by them and yet dwelling in them.\nHope in God, O my soul! Hope in the only one in whom you really can!\nMy soul does indeed thirst for God. But where is hope?\nBy day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:8 His love is steadfast. All his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness (Psalm 25:10). And he is the God of my life‚∏∫the God of my whole life.\nThe Lord is not ignorant of nor indifferent to what is happening in my life. He has plans and purposes for me that are beyond my understanding. He is ambitious for me in ways that would blow my mind if I only knew. He is transforming me into the likeness of Christ, and he knows how to do it, O how he knows! He is the God of my life.\nWhat must I do then? I must trust. I must trust the God of my life, who knows his work.\nAnd what is this song that is with me through the night, when tears are my only food? The psalmist knew.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:14 Isaiah knew.\n‚ÄúBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 12:2 But these are borrowed words. They are Moses\u0026rsquo; words. This is Moses\u0026rsquo; song.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father\u0026rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.\n‚Äï Exodus 15:2 And what is the context of Moses\u0026rsquo; song?\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\nThus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.\n‚Äï Exodus 14:21, 30-31 This song must be the refrain of your life: the habit of remembering who the Lord is and what he has done. It is the habit of remembering as you do the dishes, as you drive to work, as you grapple with the challenges of life. It is the habit of remembering the God of your life and the great power that he uses to rescue those he loves. Dwell in that, my soul.\nAnd do not underestimate the discipline and determination required to sing this song, to make it the habit of your life, but this you must do, single-mindedly, doggedly, courageously. It is a matter of life and death. Take your eyes off yourself, look to the Lord and hope in him. There is no other.\nHope in the Lord, O my soul, for there is no other! üôè\n","date":"2024-05-21T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/jeremy-bishop-DLICfSD33as-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2634415_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/","title":"Hope in God"}]
