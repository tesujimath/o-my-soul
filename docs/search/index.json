[{"content":"O my soul,\nWhat happened yesterday?\nWere you hoping for great things? Were you expecting great things? And are you tempted to say, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù? That nothing happened? (You would be so very wrong about that, by the way.)\nAnd if you think that nothing happened yesterday, now what? What will you do now? Where is hope? How can hope survive the passing of yet another day, the unrelenting accumulation of which become inexorable years? How can faith survive this, O my soul? How will this rollercoaster of expectation and disappointment not simply grind you down into the dust?\nHow indeed?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how. There are three reasons. The first reason is to understand that disappointment is a lie.\nDisappointment is a lie because it presupposes failure. But what failure would that be, exactly?\nListen to Joshua, now old and well advanced in years, passing on some wisdom at the end of his own life to those who would come after him.\nAnd now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.\n‚Äï Joshua 23:14 Not one of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promises had failed, nor has failed, nor will fail. Know that he is faithful and true, O my soul, to all that he has said, and to all that he is!\nAnd if you think that what you were hoping for yesterday didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, what you were expecting, what you were so committed in faith to receiving, then listen to the Lord himself, speaking through Isaiah.\n‚ÄúI am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,‚Äô calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 46:9-11 For sure, there are things not yet done, but there is none like God, declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient times. O my soul, he will do it! He will accomplish all he has purposed! Know that nothing has failed. Trust him still and praise him!\nThe second reason is because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts. Poured out for you, O my soul.\nTherefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,‚ÄØand hope does not put us to shame, because God\u0026rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:1-5 I will have to return another time to rejoicing in our sufferings but for now consider just that final verse, for which the Berean Standard Bible rendition is particularly helpful.\nAnd hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:5 BSB Hope does not disappoint. God himself is both the giver and the one who pours. It is his own great love. He poured out that same love at Calvary, O my soul. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God!\nThe third and final reason is to understand at least something of what did actually happen yesterday.\nWhat was I hoping for? Isaiah knows.\nOh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:1 I was hoping that the Creator God of the Universe, awesome in power and terrifying in purity but also so very good and kind, would break into this impossible situation, breathing out grace and truth and power into my own life and those around me.\nSo did he?\nFrom of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.\n‚Äï Isaiah 64:4 Isaiah tells us that the Lord acts. Not that he will act, or even that he did act, but that he acts, in the present tense. He is working right now with great power for those who wait for him. Will you be that, O my soul? Will you continue to be that?\nAnd what is it that he is doing?\nHabbakuk knows and it cannot be told.\n‚ÄúLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.‚Äù\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 Wonder and be astounded, O my soul, at what the Lord is already doing in your life, and renounce disappointment! üôè\n","date":"2024-06-04T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/istrfry-marcus-NX0WjgdQl58-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_1794935_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/that-was-yesterday/","title":"That was yesterday"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhen do you expect change will come?\nAfter so many years spent hoping and trusting, holding on to your promise from the Lord and yet still waiting, are you tempted to give up?\nOr do you still somehow expect that the Lord will act with great power to fulfil that promise? And when exactly do you expect that?\nThere is only one answer which honours the Lord and that is today. You must continue to expect it and you must expect it today! It is imperative that you do so. Your very faith depends upon it. Your life and health and strength depend upon it. How else could you live a life that honours him, other than in complete trust and dependence upon him, and other than in expectation of the imminent outworking of his great power in your life?\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23 He who promised is indeed faithful. His very name is Faithful and True (Rev 19:11).\nBut why is it quite so important to hold fast to this hope, this expectation of imminent fulfilment, without wavering?\nWe are in the midst of a spiritual battle and the fighting is fierce. To expect anything other than imminent fulfilment would open the door to doubt ‚∏∫that doubt which is so ready to creep in and steal away hope and joy and expectation. That doubt which would cause all to unravel and expose the tattered remains of a faith which once was. That doubt which must be resisted with all strength. Be steadfast, O my soul! Cry out to the Faithful One, Lord I believe! Help my unbelief!\nSo Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. And Elijah came near to all the people and said, ‚ÄúHow long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.‚Äù And the people did not answer him a word.\nAnd they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, ‚ÄúO Baal, answer us!‚Äù But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‚ÄúCry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:20-21, 26-27 O my soul, are you tempted to such thoughts while you wait on the living God, the God of your life? Repudiate them!\nAnd at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, ‚ÄúO LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.‚Äù Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, ‚ÄúThe LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Kings 18:36-39 The Lord, he is God! Praise him, O my soul!\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer to our most earnest praying, the outworking of his mighty strength in our lives to fulfil all that he has promised, is that all may know that the Lord, he is God! And his grace and kindness is that you, O my soul, may know it. Expect it today!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more.\nOur experience of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great power being outworked in our lives is limited only by our faith to believe it, our faith to receive it. This is why it is quite so important that we do not hold back in expectation.\nAnd as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 9:27-30 O my soul, do you believe that he is able to do this? According to your faith be it done to you. Do not hold back in expectation!\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s yet more.\n‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 3:16-18 What do you dare to believe, O my soul, of the only Son of God. Do not hold back in expectation!\nThis is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:24 This is the day, O my soul! Expect great things in it! üôè\n","date":"2024-05-28T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/this-is-the-day/robert-lukeman-_RBcxo9AU-U-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_13878957_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/this-is-the-day/","title":"This is the day!"},{"content":"O my soul,\nWhy are you downcast?\nIs your life not as it once was? Are you grieving for things that once were and are no longer? So was the psalmist.\nThese things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:4 Here is a man who used to live a life of affirmation and exaltation. But things changed and he became a pariah, even in his own church.\nAs with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:10 Or perhaps, O my soul, does the Lord seem to have withdrawn? Are you no longer enjoying that intimacy, the sweetness of his felt presence in your life? Nor was the psalmist. But the desire for that had not left him.\nMy soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù\n‚Äï Psalm 42:2-3 The multitude keeping festival, those privileged and self-satisfied ones, had closed ranks, and he was no longer among them. And it seemed to him that God himself had passed him by, forgotten him, rejected him. He was oppressed, scorned, and despised.\nIs there any hope? Is anything to be done?\nWhy are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation‚ÄØand my God.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:5-6, also v11 and Psalm 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? This is not a question in search of an answer. This is a rebuke. It is a rebuke delivered to one who has taken their eyes off the Lord, and has become overwhelmed by their own difficulties and disappointments, defeated by them and yet dwelling in them.\nHope in God, O my soul! Hope in the only one in whom you really can!\nMy soul does indeed thirst for God. But where is hope?\nBy day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.\n‚Äï Psalm 42:8 His love is steadfast. All his paths are steadfast love and faithfulness (Psalm 25:10). And he is the God of my life‚∏∫the God of my whole life.\nThe Lord is not ignorant of nor indifferent to what is happening in my life. He has plans and purposes for me that are beyond my understanding. He is ambitious for me in ways that would blow my mind if I only knew. He is transforming me into the likeness of Christ, and he knows how to do it, O how he knows! He is the God of my life.\nWhat must I do then? I must trust. I must trust the God of my life, who knows his work.\nAnd what is this song that is with me through the night, when tears are my only food? The psalmist knew.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.\n‚Äï Psalm 118:14 Isaiah knew.\n‚ÄúBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 12:2 But these are borrowed words. They are Moses\u0026rsquo; words. This is Moses\u0026rsquo; song.\nThe LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father\u0026rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.\n‚Äï Exodus 15:2 And what is the context of Moses\u0026rsquo; song?\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\nThus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.\n‚Äï Exodus 14:21, 30-31 This song must be the refrain of your life: the habit of remembering who the Lord is and what he has done. It is the habit of remembering as you do the dishes, as you drive to work, as you grapple with the challenges of life. It is the habit of remembering the God of your life and the great power that he uses to rescue those he loves. Dwell in that, my soul.\nAnd do not underestimate the discipline and determination required to sing this song, to make it the habit of your life, but this you must do, single-mindedly, doggedly, courageously. It is a matter of life and death. Take your eyes off yourself, look to the Lord and hope in him. There is no other.\nHope in the Lord, O my soul, for there is no other! üôè\n","date":"2024-05-21T07:00:00+12:00","image":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/jeremy-bishop-DLICfSD33as-unsplash_hu5459c0360c2b0cb7a147d2df0eb350ca_2634415_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://omysoul.faith/hope-in-god/","title":"Hope in God"}]
