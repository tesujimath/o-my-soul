        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/levels-of-understanding/juliana-malta-5MIe3FWAvoI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Levels of understanding" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think you have understood what the Lord is doing in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect your level of understanding may be far less than you have thought. Consider Mary, hearing from the angel Gabriel standing right in front of her and speaking plainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”⁠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:30-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lot for her to take in! What did she actually understand? The most confronting element was surely that even as a virgin she would be having a baby, and this was evidently foremost in her mind. How much do you think she understood about the rest⸺who he would be and what he would do? At this point in the story we cannot know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards her relative Elizabeth reminded her of what she had been told and affirmed her in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&amp;hellip; And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:41b-42a, 45&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to be reminded of what the Lord had said, and to be affirmed in receiving and believing it? O my soul, you must not neglect to remind of and to affirm in such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps solely because of this affirmation and encouragement from Elizabeth was Mary able to go to the next level in understanding this impossible thing the Lord would do in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:46-49&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see Mary just beginning to come to terms with the magnitude of what the Lord was doing in her and through her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she was still just beginning and her understanding was still so partial. Consider what happened on the night of Jesus&amp;rsquo; birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 2:8-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated ponder here can mean combine, or come together, or confer with oneself. This was the third miraculous revelation, and Mary was still piecing things together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it continued beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 2:22, 25-33&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there have been four instances of miraculous revelation and still Mary is marvelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She couldn&amp;rsquo;t know yet but more than thirty years would pass before she would step up two more truly momentous levels in understanding, one heartbreaking and one joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 19:16b-18, 25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Mary remembering those previous revelations? The hope and the joy of the world? Surely Simeon&amp;rsquo;s words spoken at Jesus&amp;rsquo; dedication in the temple would have come flooding back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 2:34-35&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely was her own soul pierced on this darkest of days. But something more was to be revealed to Jesus&amp;rsquo; disciples just days later after his glorious resurrection, and we can presume that Mary too climbed to that joyous level of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 24:45-47&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what may we conclude from Mary’s journey of incremental understanding, beginning with the angel standing before her and speaking plainly, and steadily increasing over a period of more than thirty years? O my soul, do not presume to think you have just now any more than a partial understanding of what the Lord is doing in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to surrender in praise and awe and wonder along with the Apostle Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 11:33&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is richer and deeper in every way, and will be revealed step by step as you trust and submit yourself to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will with rejoicing in ever increasing surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And know that understanding is not as necessary as perhaps you had thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more thing to know, and to hold on to in the inevitable and ongoing state of your own partial understanding, and that is that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s understanding is not partial. He knows and he understands and he is good beyond our own understanding, and that is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, in humility and surrender know and accept that your own understanding is partial, so rest in these plans and purposes of the Lord and in his unfathomable peace! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Be angry</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/be-angry/todd-trapani-91T-rq-pY28-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Be angry" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you make of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be angry, and do not sin;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:4a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be angry. Why? It is commanded! And in that, do not sin. How? How can this be done? We&amp;rsquo;ll need to give some serious thought to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by considering the new life that is in Christ. Paul sets the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.  When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 3:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not progress past this too quickly⸺it is heady truth indeed! I have died and my life is hidden with Christ in God. My eternal being is secure and unassailable. Indeed my very life is Christ. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what then? Paul continues in typical fashion with a therefore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 3:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these have any place in the new life, and of these things that must be put away, did you notice that anger appeared first in the list? But still,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be angry, and do not sin;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:4a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may conclude that there are two different kinds of anger. And indeed the words are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the anger which must be put aside, having no place in the new life in Christ, Paul uses the Greek word &lt;em&gt;orgē&lt;/em&gt;, which is an anger full of emotion, violent passion in fact. This is the anger of not getting one&amp;rsquo;s own way. It is the anger of a bruised ego. And the word used for wrath means rage or passion. It is selfish, even childish in its inability to show restraint. Those must be put aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist wrote in Hebrew, which precludes direct comparison, but Paul also writes of the anger of the psalmist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 4:26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he uses the Greek word &lt;em&gt;parorgismos&lt;/em&gt;, which means indignation or wrath or exasperation. This is not rage. This is a righteous anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the command is to be angry with that righteous anger, with indignation at what ought not to be. But what is that? What should be the object of such anger? To answer that let&amp;rsquo;s consider what was the object of Jesus&amp;rsquo; anger⸺for from time to time he was indeed angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’ But you have made it a den of robbers.” And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 11:15-18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were the subject of his anger were very much on the inside of the religious establishment of the day, but their behaviour was brazen in its dishonouring of the Lord. Worthy of anger, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way each gospel writer orders their account is interesting and surely rich in meaning. There&amp;rsquo;s just such a juxtaposition here which must be noticed, for this account of Jesus clearing the temple is immediately followed by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 11:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you recall how I &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/hard-teaching/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;grappled previously&lt;/a&gt; with this hard teaching of the poor little fig tree being cursed for failing to bear figs out of season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; anger with that fig tree paralleled his anger with the Pharisees⸺those heinously prideful ones who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom but were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s return to our psalm and observe the context out of which it is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the psalm as a whole we see a man earnestly desiring to live a right life before the Lord while being so very aware of his dependence upon the Lord for that. O my soul, do you know this humble passion for personal holiness combined with complete dependence on Christ for his righteousness? I know that you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist has been in distress previously, and is again, and why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O men, how long shall my honour be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist is despised and rejected by vain and dishonest men. And who are they? Their description is nuanced, literally &lt;em&gt;sons of men&lt;/em&gt;. The ESV alternative translation renders it &lt;em&gt;men of rank&lt;/em&gt;. So, privileged ones. Exalted ones. Vain and dishonest. Pharisees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be angry, O my soul, you must be angry at that which ought not to be, that which so dishonours the Lord, that pride and hypocrisy. And do not sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how are we not to sin in this? There are two ways. The psalmist tells us the first right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:4-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, in your own righteous anger know that you are not called to table-flipping and temple-clearing. That is Jesus&amp;rsquo; work. Ponder on your bed and be silent. Put your trust in the Lord. Do you think he hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen this heinous behaviour? Do you think he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know? Do you think he won&amp;rsquo;t respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Paul tells us the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 4:26-27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? Do not let the sun go down on your anger. Do not hold on to it. You must lay it down and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 12:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And where does that leave the psalmist? Blessed and at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound. In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 4:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, be angry and do not sin! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
