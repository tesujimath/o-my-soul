        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/nils-leonhardt-Tss1uOMczDg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Heal me O Lord!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else do you long for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you long for healing? Do you long for rescue? Do you long for deliverance? Then cry out to God. And as you do, trust in him. Trust him completely. For there is a terrible pitfall for those who long for healing, for deliverance, for change, and it is this: to think that you can make it happen yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD: ‚ÄúCursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD. He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:5-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not think for a moment that you&amp;rsquo;ve got this. It is completely beyond you. You must repudiate that rugged individualism that says you can make it by yourself, for once you start down that road of self-reliance and independence you will gradually become locked in to that way of thinking‚∏∫a shrub in the desert trying to tough it out in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited and uninhabitable salt land. Self-reliance and dependence on God are mutually exclusive. The rugged little shrub in the desert thinks less and less about the Lord and his power to save, and more and more about itself and how to survive, and inevitably its heart turns away from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that what you want? For there is another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be that tree planted by water, you must not only trust in the Lord, but your trust must &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the Lord. Understand what that means. It is trust that is all in, fully committed, as if your very life depends on it, because it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice something here. The tree planted by the water is not anxious in the year of drought for it does not cease to bear fruit. The Lord uses for his Kingdom purposes even the one crying out for deliverance. The one who trusts in the Lord does not cease to bear fruit, and there is enormous affirmation in that. What a testimony to the grace and power of God. His power is made perfect in our weakness and his grace is fully sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And notice too the parallel between the tree of life standing on the river of life whose leaves are for the healing of the nations, and this tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and whose leaves remain green. Are you starting to understand the magnitude of the blessing for the one who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord? It is simply astonishing. The power and grace are completely overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, notice what must be in that place of desperate longing for healing, for rescue, for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you, O Lord, are my praise. This is what must be, and you must ensure to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, never stop crying out to the Lord for rescue and deliverance, and in that place of longing, be sure to make him your praise! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-river-of-life/ignacio-aguilar-PK32VXa8LGM-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The river of life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What keeps you going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 46:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is indeed our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. So very present. The ESV footnote reveals that this may also mean well proven. A well proven help in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, are you familiar with the reality of this? A well proven help in trouble is not theoretical. It is physical and actual and real, and there is track record. Remember back to a time you knew the very present help of God‚∏∫his character being revealed, his faithfulness to his beloved ones‚∏∫his faithfulness to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As faithful as the Lord has been, so he remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I the LORD do not change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/malachi&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Malachi 3:6a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we need his faithfulness, for as we look around this broken world we do indeed see the earth give way and mountains fall into the heart of the sea. What turbulent times are these!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in these turbulent times we must take comfort from the entirety of the psalm, so notice what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 46:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this river, and what can we know about it? And what is the city of God, and how can it be glad? All of this was revealed to the Apostle John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 22:1-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The river is the water of life. O my soul, drink deeply of this water of life and slake your thirst. Come to Jesus and drink!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, ‚ÄúIf anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.‚ÄØWhoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‚ÄòOut of his heart will flow rivers of living water.‚Äô‚Äù Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 7:37-39&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‚ÄúBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 21:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy city is the bride of Christ, his church for whom he died for the joy which was set before him. The joy of saving hopeless and helpless sinners. His joy in saving me and his joy in saving you. The joy that enabled him to endure the cross, scorning its shame (Hebrews 12:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it be like, in this city, that will make it glad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all to come. But what of now? For the psalm is rooted in this present age. But notice that even in this present age is the city of God, the bride of Christ, his church, made glad by his streams of living water. This is now. And there is one profound truth that is in common between that joyous day when tears are wiped away and the current turbulent time of the psalmist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God himself will be with them as their God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 21:3b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns. The nations rage, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 46:5-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord of Hosts is with his people, his beloved ones, his city, and he is infinite in power and glory. For while these mountains fall into the heart of the sea in the tumult of our age and the earth gives way, the Lord speaks and the earth melts. And listen to what he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 46:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, immerse yourself in the river of life, and be still and know that he is God and that he is with you! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pick up your mat</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/pick-up-your-mat/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/pick-up-your-mat/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/pick-up-your-mat/davidsonluna-yOzIE5VTEpo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Pick up your mat" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be healed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. In these lay a multitude of invalids‚∏∫blind, lame, and paralyzed. One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, ‚ÄúDo you want to be healed?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 5:2-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that already a confronting question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you want to be healed? It is Jesus who is asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the man in the story, an invalid for thirty-eight years. Surely at this stage in his life, his affliction had become part of his identity. Was he prepared to give that up? Would he know who he was if he were well? Did he even want to be healed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider other kinds of affliction. Some live in pain. So much pain. Ongoing pain. Exquisite pain. Pain that has become part of life, like an old friend. Almost comforting. Part of their identity. And so perhaps almost subconsciously they choose to continue in that pain rather than to be healed, establishing patterns of thought and behaviour which become their own prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you even want to be healed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sick man answered him, ‚ÄúSir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúGet up, take up your bed, and walk.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 5:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the sick man&amp;rsquo;s justification of his ongoing affliction. Didn&amp;rsquo;t he make his own plight out to be inevitable? But Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in his excuses or his justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGet up, take up your bed, and walk.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 5:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the sick man was immediately confronted with two questions. Did he want to be healed, and did he believe Jesus could do that for him? For what is the prerequisite for receiving healing if not faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe what happened on a different occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 9:27-30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to your faith be it done to you. We have been here before and quite recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, this remains Jesus&amp;rsquo; question to you. ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù And if your answer is, yes Lord, and you even want to be healed then simply pick up your mat and walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this question of faith challenges you. Perhaps it is too much. Perhaps this obstacle is defeating you. If so, there is good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 5:18-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! I wonder what the home-owner thought of the actions of this man&amp;rsquo;s faithful friends, breaking through the roof of his house. They clearly didn&amp;rsquo;t care about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when he saw their faith, he said, ‚ÄúMan, your sins are forgiven you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.‚Äù And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 5:20, 24b-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus healed this man when he saw &lt;em&gt;the faith of his friends&lt;/em&gt;. That was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is how you answer Jesus&amp;rsquo; question, do you want to be healed? Get up, pick up your mat, and walk. Will you do this? It is your articulation of faith and hope in the only Son of God, the risen Lord Jesus, infinite in power and splendour, who stands at the door and knocks. And if you lack the faith to believe for yourself, rest upon the faith of your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what of those who have imprisoned themselves in debilitating patterns of thought and behaviour, having adopted that ongoing and exquisite pain as part of their very identity? The answer for them is what Jesus spoke at the beginning of his earthly ministry, and it is a joyous and liberating and life-giving answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 4:17-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what became of the man in our story, the invalid of thirty-eight years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 5:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist knew what was required to receive blessing and healing from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 37:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, commit your way to the Lord, trust in him, and pick up your mat and walk! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do you want me to do for you?</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/jj-ying-9Qwbfa_RM94-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What do you want me to do for you?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you told Jesus what you want him to do for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in ambition or covetousness or grasping or self-interest, and neither is he, but rather life and health and strength and deliverance and mercy. Have you told him what you want him to do for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As [Jesus] drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. They told him, ‚ÄúJesus of Nazareth is passing by.‚Äù And he cried out, ‚ÄúJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!‚Äù And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, ‚ÄúSon of David, have mercy on me!‚Äù And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:35-41a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this interesting? ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù This question was asked by the Word of Life himself, the omniscient Creator God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 1:1-5, 14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus already knew this blind man whose name was Bartimaeus. He knew his hopes and his dreams and his heartbreak and the debilitating affliction of his blindness. He was and is the giver of life itself, the one who knows and the one who loves and the one who heals, and yet, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Jesus ask this? Consider Bartimaeus&amp;rsquo; answer and what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight.‚Äù ‚ÄØAnd Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúRecover your sight; your faith has made you well.‚Äù And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:41b-43&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much faith is articulated in that simple request, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight‚Äù? O my soul, if you would receive from Jesus you must believe. A previous encounter with two other blind men teaches us this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, ‚ÄúHave mercy on us, Son of David.‚Äù When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you believe that I am able to do this?‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord.‚Äù Then he touched their eyes, saying, ‚ÄúAccording to your faith be it done to you.‚Äù And their eyes were opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 9:27-30a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, according to your faith be it done to you. Even if you are that desperate father of the boy with the unclean spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBut if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚Äú‚ÄòIf you can!‚Äô All things are possible for one who believes.‚Äù Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, ‚ÄúI believe; help my unbelief!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 9:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want Jesus to do for you? If you believe that he can, you must ask him. Did Jesus not say as much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 7:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we finish, there&amp;rsquo;s something to notice from the context of the account of Bartimaeus&amp;rsquo; healing in Luke&amp;rsquo;s gospel. Do not overlook that the Bible was written under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit. It is hugely significant how the various accounts were assembled, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what else Luke put together here in what later became Chapter Eighteen of his gospel. There are five preceding paragraphs and they are all so very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the parable of the persistent widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, don&amp;rsquo;t give up telling Jesus what you want him to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must ask Jesus as one crying out for mercy. You deserve nothing, so repudiate that spirit of entitlement which is always so eager to raise its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is of the little children whom the disciples rebuked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Jesus called them to him, saying, ‚ÄúLet the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:16-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/receiving-the-kingdom-of-god-like-a-little-child/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;be that little child and depend on Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. Has there ever been such an age as ours of rugged individualism? When Jesus asks, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù would you reply, ‚ÄúAh, I&amp;rsquo;m alright thanks Jesus, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this‚Äù?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth is the tragic story of the rich young ruler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus &amp;hellip; said to him, ‚ÄúOne thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.‚Äù But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, ‚ÄúHow difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:22-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must want Jesus and his Kingdom above all else. And do not overlook what Jesus said next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he said, ‚ÄúWhat is impossible with man is possible with God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do not hold back in what you ask Jesus to do for you, even if it seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fifth and final and by far the most important is Jesus again telling his disciples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:31-33&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, the very Son of God poured out his life for you on that cross at Calvary, and today and every day he pours out his love. His death paid in full both your own debt and that of all humankind. His resurrection is victory over sin and death and all that drags you down. Praise, O my soul, the King of Heaven!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartimaeus did not hold back in telling Jesus what he wanted him to do for him, and neither must you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do for you?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúLord, let me recover my sight.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúRecover your sight; your faith has made you well.‚Äù And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:41-43&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when all the people see what Jesus does for humble sinners who ask in faith, believing and not doubting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, believe and do not doubt, and tell Jesus the full extent of what you want him to do for you! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
