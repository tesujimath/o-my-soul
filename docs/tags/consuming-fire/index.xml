        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/through-the-fire/kilauea-summit-eruption.png" alt="Featured image of post Through the fire" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you understood what “through the fire” means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am of course referring to that uplifting song, The Goodness of God, which is addressed directly to the Lord. The chorus asserts “all my life you have been faithful”, and verse two, “you have led me through the fire”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have all who cherish this song really understood what this means? Through does not mean out of without first into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would a faithful God lead me into the fire? And since this is just a song we have to ask, does Scripture even support this idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear the word of the Lord through Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my name&amp;rsquo;s sake I defer my anger; for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off. Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction. For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 48:9-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these whom the Lord has refined in the furnace of affliction? Isaiah tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 48:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Israelites, God&amp;rsquo;s chosen people, who confess his name, but crucially &lt;em&gt;not in truth or right&lt;/em&gt;. They are in fact hypocrites, lacking integrity, lacking honesty, lacking righteousness. And so the Lord refines them in the furnace of affliction. And why? For his own sake and for his own glory. Otherwise how would his name be profaned, dishonoured by these hypocrites professing his name in falsehood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notice how the Lord restrains his anger at these hypocrites. He holds it back for the sake of his praise and instead he chooses to refine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was this furnace of affliction? It was the eighteen month siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar followed by the exile of Judah to Babylon, truly &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/but-this-i-call-to-mind-and-therefore-i-have-hope/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the grimmest of times&lt;/a&gt;. Into the fire indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And was that enough? Was that to be the end of the refining? No it was not. Upon their return to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile there is a further prophecy from Zechariah, again of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s own chosen people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive. And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zechariah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zechariah 13:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thirds perished and the remaining one third was to be put into the fire by the hand of the Lord. And then what? The Lord will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we must endeavour to understand the two different kinds of refining, one which is not as silver and one which is. This is certainly difficult to understand and it seems to me to be a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/hard-teaching/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hard teaching&lt;/a&gt; indeed. But we must not shy away from such verses! The commentaries differ and so this must be approached with humility. And yet surely we must wrestle with these hard teachings with both intellectual integrity and reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When silver is refined, the whole of it is purified and all the silver is retained. Dross is removed from throughout and from throughout pure silver is retrieved. Nothing is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is a refining not as silver? I believe it may be a separation, as of sheep and goats. Not all are accepted. Some are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people to whom Isaiah prophesied were to be refined but not as silver. Later, after the return from the exile, two thirds perished. Rejected. Discarded. One third remained to be further refined, and this time as silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my soul, cry out to the Lord lest you be refined but not as silver, for both kinds of refining remain. Listen to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:31-32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, there is to be such a separation. Pray for mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:33-40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides praying for mercy you must be sure to love and care for the least. For as you do to each of these you do to Jesus himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:41-46&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; warning in the Sermon on the Mount was both urgent and stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 7:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cry out to the Lord for mercy, love him with all of your heart, and trust him in everything. And know that just as he leads into the fire, he also leads out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried. You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs; you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 66:10-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see both into and out of. Truly through the fire and out to a place of abundance. Do not forget the words of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 10:10b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, trust the Lord, knowing that if he leads you into the fire he does indeed know what he is doing, and it is for his praise and his glory. May the name of the Lord be praised! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Locusts</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/locusts/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 06:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/locusts/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/locusts/Exodus_10.webp" alt="Featured image of post Locusts" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those years the locusts have eaten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/joel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Joel 2:25a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this sound like a wonderful promise of restoration? But what does it mean? To understand those years we must first understand the locusts. So what are the locusts? I have quoted only half a verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/joel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Joel 2:25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of the Lord, and so these are his own locusts, his great army, which he sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear this, you elders; give ear, all inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers? Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten. What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten, and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/joel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Joel 1:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever is going on here clearly was and is of vital importance and must be remembered. Notice the urgent exhortation to pay attention, to tell the children and the children&amp;rsquo;s children, not to forget even through the generations. We ourselves must not overlook this. It is as relevant today as it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn more from Zephaniah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD. “I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the rubble with the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these wicked ones who have brought down such judgment from the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:4a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Lord&amp;rsquo;s chosen people, the hitherto recipients of his covenant love. And this is a prophecy of the day of the Lord, that terrible day of judgment and destruction rained down by the Lord on his own people, his beloved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? Why would this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will punish the officials and the king&amp;rsquo;s sons and all who array themselves in foreign attire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s people, his highest and most exalted ones, had become so compromised, so contaminated by the nations. So worldly. So like us in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are complacent, those who say in their hearts, ‘The LORD will not do good, nor will he do ill.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you think this couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to us? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that thought the very definition of complacency? That the Lord will not do good, nor will he do ill? That everything will just continue to tick along as we all go about our lives? That the extent of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s interest is merely to observe? O my soul, repudiate such thinking. Purge that complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then should be done in the face of this day of judgment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:7a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you so full of bluster? So full of excuses? So full of self-justification? Be silent! Be silent before the Lord God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his just commands; seek righteousness; seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the anger of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 2:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be silent and humble ourselves and seek righteousness and humility. But where may these be found in the midst of all this negligence and self-indulgence and intransigence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John tells us of the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 2:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Paul tells us of the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek righteousness and humility. Seek Jesus. Cry out to him for salvation and turn to him so that you may be hidden on that terrible day of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 3:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:28-29&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us repent of complacency and brainless triumphalism, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s something else to notice here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 1:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord has indeed prepared a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 22:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 9:24-26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has the Lord prepared the sacrifice of his only Son at such enormous cost, but through him he has also consecrated his guests. O my soul, your own consecration is ongoing, as you are so very aware. Rejoice that it continues and exult with all your heart at the lavish generosity of this restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; he has cleared away your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 3:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And observe how the Lord himself rejoices to see his people returning to him in repentance and humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/zephaniah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, be quieted by that great Calvary love, rejoice and give thanks to the one who restores those years! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
