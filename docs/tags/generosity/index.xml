        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-entitlement-trap/malcolm-lightbody-TQfV8lVw7jQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The entitlement trap" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else did Jesus say about that treasure in heaven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, what is the very next thing he said? Let&amp;rsquo;s pick up where we left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFor the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:29-30, 20:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you remember this being the introduction to the parable of the labourers in the vineyard? We&amp;rsquo;d better reacquaint ourselves with that parable then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it starts with an agreement of a denarius a day for working in the vineyard. That was a right and true payment for a day&amp;rsquo;s work. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t riches, but it was enough to live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the crux of the parable is what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and to them he said, ‚ÄòYou go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.‚Äô So they went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 20:3-5a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever known an employment contract like this? How many try to nail down every last aspect of an agreement before entering into it? But here we see something else. Here we see trust. We see the new hires trusting the master of the house to do what was right and true. And as we shall see, they were not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‚ÄòWhy do you stand here idle all day?‚Äô They said to him, ‚ÄòBecause no one has hired us.‚Äô He said to them, ‚ÄòYou go into the vineyard too.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 20:5b-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look how the character of God is already shining through in this story of the master hiring labourers for his vineyard. Not only do we see one who is trustworthy and true, but we see generosity towards those in need. Did it make any difference to him whether those left idle came to join his workers, given there was so little time left to be about his work? Not in the slightest! But it made a difference to them, such a difference. So the master says, more! Let more come in to my vineyard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in particular with regard to employment, doesn&amp;rsquo;t this often seem to be unreasonably hard? Ought it not be straightforward to find honest and appropriate work? But it so rarely is. And there is a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And to Adam [the Lord] said, ‚ÄúBecause you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 3:17-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we should expect work to remain hard until the end of our lives, and we have no-one but ourselves to blame for that. But notice in our parable the grace extended by the master of the house, welcoming into his employ those whom others had rejected. Such is the Father heart of God‚∏∫a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so now we come to the crunch, the reason for the parable, and it is not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‚ÄòCall the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 20:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the last. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this seem to be a constant refrain throughout Jesus&amp;rsquo; teaching? The last will be first and the first last. We heard it twice even in these few verses. So why are so many striving to be first? Do they simply not believe Jesus?‚∏∫the one whose name is Faithful and True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, saying, ‚ÄòThese last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.‚Äô But he replied to one of them, ‚ÄòFriend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 20:9-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something ugly here, and it afflicts many in the Kingdom. The ugliness is called entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the source of this entitlement? Is it not in comparison and envy? Is it not in that misguided and deeply held belief, I deserve more than this, because I am better than them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must notice that self-centred tendency in your own heart so you may repudiate it. Replace it with rejoicing in the goodness and generosity of the Father to all‚∏∫each one made in the image of God, and each one deeply loved.  The Father cares for each one, because each one matters to him. Each one was bought for a high price, and each one has a part to play in the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòAm I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?‚Äô So the last will be first, and the first last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 20:15-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you begrudge the generosity of the Lord to those whom you look down upon? To those whom you count as less? To those to whom you yourself are entirely indifferent? May it not be so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there is such a strong word of warning here for the begrudgers, and that word is so. Such a little word, but of such profound importance. So the last will be first, and the first last. This is the reason. This is how it happens. This is how those already richly blessed in the Kingdom find themselves with so much less than they were expecting. So much less than they thought they were entitled to. Because of that entitlement. Because of that begrudging. Because of that self-centredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how is it that the last may be first? Simply by responding to the unmerited favour of the Lord with grateful and obedient hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, repudiate that entitlement, rejoice in the generosity of the Father to all, and be grateful! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to be rich</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 06:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/dan-dennis-pZ56pVKd_6c-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to be rich" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to be rich? Really rich? It is desperately important to be so, because otherwise you will have nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And [Jesus] said to them, ‚ÄúTake care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one&amp;rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.‚Äù And he told them a parable, saying, ‚ÄúThe land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‚ÄòWhat shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòI will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, ‚ÄúSoul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.‚Äô‚Äù But God said to him, ‚ÄòFool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?‚Äô So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:15-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is about being rich towards God. What did you think I was asking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encountered this parable last week in the context of being looked after by our Heavenly Father but we didn&amp;rsquo;t adequately consider being rich towards God, so let&amp;rsquo;s do that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s begin with Jesus&amp;rsquo; own commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he said to them, ‚ÄúTake care, and be on your guard against all covetousness.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:15a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To covet means to long to possess, and not only what belongs to others. Coveting one&amp;rsquo;s own possessions is a perennial snare to the one who would be rich towards God, for such coveting creates treasures on earth in blatant disregard of Jesus&amp;rsquo; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDo not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:19-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How tragic to convert a potential asset for the Kingdom into the casualty of moth and rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what else did Jesus say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:33-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is again. Your possessions are assets for the Kingdom, and they wholly belong to the King. So use them for Kingdom work and you will be rich with treasure in heaven which is immune to both moth and rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who live in modern Western affluence must be particularly vigilant. For ours is a culture of rugged individualism and indifference towards those in need. O my soul, beware lest you make your benchmark that of the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jesus&amp;rsquo; warning continues into the parable of the master returning from the wedding feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúStay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:35-36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is surely about living lives consistent with what we have received, and at all times. We won&amp;rsquo;t get into this now, except to notice a portent for any who would excuse their own lack of concern for others by using the benchmark of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd that servant who knew his master&amp;rsquo;s will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:47-48&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus expects far more of those within the church than those without. Of course he does! We who have so richly received and who know his will, how then could we hold back in blessing others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/james&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;James 2:14-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead, no less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And know that loving one another has a high cost. Will you bear it? It helps to remember the cost which was borne for you at Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world&amp;rsquo;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&amp;rsquo;s love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 3:16-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do what pleases God in loving one another and in every other way and you will be rich beyond imagining! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
