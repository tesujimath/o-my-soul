        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/a-love-song/darius-F8E2tks5N04-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A love song" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your heart overflowing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 2:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay much closer attention then. But to what? To what must we pay closer attention? How about this love song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah; a love song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45 heading&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in fact is the very best of love songs. O my soul, are you ready to sing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to address the king? Is your tongue ready like the pen of a scribe? So who is this king? And what will you write? Let&amp;rsquo;s consider him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendour and majesty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This king is most handsome and mighty in splendour and majesty. But how is any of this relevant? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this merely some dusty old psalm about David or one of those other so very few noble kings of Israel. By no means!  Let us behold here something truly wondrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds! Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king&amp;rsquo;s enemies; the peoples fall under you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:4-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king&amp;rsquo;s cause is truth and meekness and righteousness. Meekness is our first real clue as to his identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The sceptre of your kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:6-8a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the reveal‚∏∫the anointing and the robes and the fragrance. For the anointing is with the oil of gladness and the fragrance is of myrrh and aloes. It is the fragrance of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After [Jesus died] Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 19:38-42&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what of cassia? Moses was instructed in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúTake the finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of aromatic cane, and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 30:22-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a holy anointing oil. It is an oil of holiness and of death and yet also an oil of gladness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where is the love song we were promised? Right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father&amp;rsquo;s house, and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. The people of Tyre will seek your favour with gifts, the richest of the people.‚Å†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:10-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the king is Jesus who is this daughter whose beauty he desires? She is the one who has made him her Lord. She is the one who has left her past behind and who is living for him. She is his church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And look how he sees her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold. In many-coloured robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her. With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:13-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is his glorious church, his beloved bride. And with joy and gladness she enters his presence, the palace of the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the love song between Jesus and his church. It is a song founded on myrrh and aloes. It is a song founded on her leaving and cleaving. It is our song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what happens as we sing this song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 45:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, sing this love song to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, that his name be remembered in all generations! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The power of the tongue</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/the-power-of-the-tongue/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 06:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/the-power-of-the-tongue/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-power-of-the-tongue/kristina-flour-BcjdbyKWquw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The power of the tongue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you be OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 34:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate the power of praise for lifting you up, out of discouragement, out of doubt, out of despair, out of the place of being despised and rejected, and into light and truth and grace and personal holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that it was the Apostle Peter who brought us to Psalm 34, writing to those in the midst of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-peter&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Peter 3:8-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of all that is broken and dysfunctional you must bless. You must be a blessing so that you may receive a blessing. So praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to this end we must acknowledge that the exhortations and the prohibitions are not here without reason. Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling. And keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we must address the severe temptation which is ever present for those who are hurting. For those who have been shamefully treated. For those who have been despised and rejected. And that is the temptation to strike back with the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 18:21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are hurting this temptation may be severe indeed‚∏∫to strike back with a fatal blow, with words spoken with intent to bring down and to destroy. Isn&amp;rsquo;t bringing down the prideful with carefully chosen words so inviting? Don&amp;rsquo;t they deserve it? Perhaps so, but O my soul, you must not do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist reflected on the ways of the arrogant and the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 73:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, will &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; tongue strut through the earth? May it not be so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 34:11-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how important it is to bridle the tongue? It is foremost among these exhortations for anyone desiring a life filled with goodness, even ahead of actually doing good and seeking peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever utters slander is a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 10:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concealed hatred poisons and corrupts the one who holds it. It&amp;rsquo;s not that it must be vented, but rather expurgated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you expect or even desire to dwell in the Lord&amp;rsquo;s presence, think on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbour, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honours those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 15:1-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you have received much grace. Be sure to give much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James warns at some length about the power of the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/james&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;James 3:9-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you defile your praise with bitterness and gall? May it not be so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tongue of the righteous is choice silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 10:20a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tongue of the wise brings healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 12:18b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gentle tongue is a tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 15:4a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tree of life, no less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, death and life are in the power of the tongue, so use yours wisely! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Heal me O Lord!</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/heal-me-o-lord/nils-leonhardt-Tss1uOMczDg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Heal me O Lord!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else do you long for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you long for healing? Do you long for rescue? Do you long for deliverance? Then cry out to God. And as you do, trust in him. Trust him completely. For there is a terrible pitfall for those who long for healing, for deliverance, for change, and it is this: to think that you can make it happen yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD: ‚ÄúCursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD. He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:5-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not think for a moment that you&amp;rsquo;ve got this. It is completely beyond you. You must repudiate that rugged individualism that says you can make it by yourself, for once you start down that road of self-reliance and independence you will gradually become locked in to that way of thinking‚∏∫a shrub in the desert trying to tough it out in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited and uninhabitable salt land. Self-reliance and dependence on God are mutually exclusive. The rugged little shrub in the desert thinks less and less about the Lord and his power to save, and more and more about itself and how to survive, and inevitably its heart turns away from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that what you want? For there is another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be that tree planted by water, you must not only trust in the Lord, but your trust must &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the Lord. Understand what that means. It is trust that is all in, fully committed, as if your very life depends on it, because it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice something here. The tree planted by the water is not anxious in the year of drought for it does not cease to bear fruit. The Lord uses for his Kingdom purposes even the one crying out for deliverance. The one who trusts in the Lord does not cease to bear fruit, and there is enormous affirmation in that. What a testimony to the grace and power of God. His power is made perfect in our weakness and his grace is fully sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And notice too the parallel between the tree of life standing on the river of life whose leaves are for the healing of the nations, and this tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and whose leaves remain green. Are you starting to understand the magnitude of the blessing for the one who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord? It is simply astonishing. The power and grace are completely overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, notice what must be in that place of desperate longing for healing, for rescue, for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you, O Lord, are my praise. This is what must be, and you must ensure to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, never stop crying out to the Lord for rescue and deliverance, and in that place of longing, be sure to make him your praise! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The sacrifice of thanksgiving</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/velizar-ivanov-V_Giq2h5jak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The sacrifice of thanksgiving" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you grateful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, joyously grateful to the one who has rescued you, redeemed you, blessed you, and given you hope and a future. Are you grateful to him with all your heart? It matters that you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have mercy on us.‚Äù When he saw them he said to them, ‚ÄúGo and show yourselves to the priests.‚Äù And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus answered, ‚ÄúWere not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?‚Äù And he said to him, ‚ÄúRise and go your way; your faith has made you well.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 17:11-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten lepers were healed but only one was sufficiently grateful to return to Jesus, to thank him and to praise God. What did Jesus say to this one alone? ‚ÄúYour faith has made you well.‚Äù Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this leave us wondering, what of the others? Did they remain healed? We don&amp;rsquo;t know and we can&amp;rsquo;t know. I suspect the generosity of the Lord towards ungrateful sinners is that they did in fact remain healed. But really, shame on them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 9:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this what gratitude must be? Ensuring to thank the Lord with your whole heart as and when you receive blessing and healing and deliverance, with the expectation of further blessing to come? By no means! O my soul, you must not settle for such an impoverished understanding of thankfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul gives us a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-thessalonians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all circumstances you must give thanks, even acknowledging that some of these circumstances are hard to bear. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider David, fleeing for his life from Saul. Listen to his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts‚∏∫the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:1, 4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound remotely like one who is receiving blessing and healing and deliverance? And yet,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in the midst of peril how does he end his psalm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:9-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something profound here which must be understood, and it is the nature of &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; in thanksgiving. Another psalmist articulates it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.‚ÄØThen I called on the name of the LORD: ‚ÄúO LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 116:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in times such as these that it is costly to give thanks, and yet it is precisely because of this that the thanksgiving becomes a sacrifice. The psalmist continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 116:15-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has he been saved or will his death imminently become precious in the sight of the Lord? It seems somewhat ambiguous to me. Is this why his thanksgiving is a sacrifice? Perhaps he will not even survive the time of crisis and yet still he gives thanks to God. This is the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and it is costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, I know your heartbreak and your longing. In these you must give thanks. And yes, that is so very painful, but you simply must. Be encouraged by the words of the Apostle Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There remain two observations still to be made and it is vital that they be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that giving thanks &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a situation of pain and grief and heartbreak is not giving thanks &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; these things, in some kind of passive-aggressive ‚Äúthank you for hurting me‚Äù way. But it is never too difficult to find something truly worthy of thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:3-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this surely remains a sacrifice of thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second may seem to be quite close to ‚Äúthank-you for hurting me‚Äù, but in fact it is not. It is the place where joy and sorrow meet and are inextricably intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O sons and daughters dearly loved, know that your Heavenly Father is so deeply invested in you there is nothing he won&amp;rsquo;t do for your eternal good. And some of these things are painful indeed to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the most painful experience, offer up to God your sacrifice of thanksgiving for such commitment and investment that he has made in you, that he will see through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph speaks the word of the Lord to those who may have forgotten this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 50:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, offer up to the Lord your sacrifice of thanksgiving however much you are hurting! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to think about</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/what-to-think-about/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 06:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/what-to-think-about/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/what-to-think-about/redd-f-LP3PabHuyiE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What to think about" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you thinking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking again about those insolent ones? And if so, why? Why would you continue to think about them? Thinking about them is not blessing you. Be assured that they are not thinking about you! Or are you dwelling on other things which drag you down? Why would you continue to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 26:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, what are you doing? Would you be building that dam on the river of life? Stop! Stop thinking about those things which drag you down. Stop dwelling on them. Stop living in them. Think instead about something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then? What must you think about? Paul tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, think about these things and be lifted up and encouraged. So what are they, these things that we must think about? Rejoice that they are many and varied, and fill your mind with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about whatever is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 19:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, think about this. Here is Jesus in all of his resurrection power and splendour, whose very name is Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war on all that is unholy. And he is victorious. Think about him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/2-samuel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Samuel 7:28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words of the Lord are true. What he has promised is true. His name is Faithful and True. Think about this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about whatever is just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, think about this. Christ died on the cross, paying the price for my sin and yours in full. If we confess our sins and cry out to God for mercy it is his justice that demands we be forgiven. The price is paid. He will not take a second payment precisely because he is just. Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 61:1,8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, know that the Lord loves justice. In power and compassion Jesus came to do justice for the poor and the oppressed. Think about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow&amp;rsquo;s cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 1:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how to do justice‚∏∫the Lord&amp;rsquo;s own justice which binds up the brokenhearted and proclaims liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound. Think about how to do this in his Spirit and by his power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what is worthy of praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:11-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear the sound of a hundred million angels singing praise to the risen Lord Jesus in his resurrection power and splendour. And hear his own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, ‚ÄúFear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 1:12-18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not, O my soul, and think about this. He is the first and the last and the living one, who died and rose again to life, and he is alive forevermore. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, why finally? Why does Paul say finally? We need to look at what came before. And what came before is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about those insolent ones or about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about these true, just, praiseworthy things, O my soul, and pray with thanksgiving, and know that the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
