&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t the parable of the persistent widow just so very uncomfortable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’” And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says. And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:1-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man, who only gave the widow what she was asking for to stop her bothering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke tells us precisely why Jesus told this parable, that we should persist in prayer and not lose heart. The parable provides insight into this. The persistent widow is me, crying out to God day and night, and the unrighteous judge is God himself⸺Father, Creator, Lord of All. And here&amp;rsquo;s what is so uncomfortable, so jarring. The character representing God in this parable is an unrighteous judge who cared only that the widow stop bothering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how the Lord receives the prayers of his beloved ones, our prayers? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first see how precious to the Lord are the prayers of his saints, us, our prayers. And for that we must look into the throne room of heaven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:6-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Lamb who was slain, the risen Lord Jesus, with eyes like a flame of fire, feet like burnished bronze, a voice like the roar of many waters, and his face like the sun shining in full strength. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here in the throne room around the Lamb are the twenty-four elders holding those golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints⸺our prayers. What next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 8:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how precious to the Lord are the prayers of the saints. They are offered on the golden altar before the throne in heaven, and are a pleasing aroma to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would be a terrible mistake to infer something of the character of God from the unrighteous judge in the parable. That is not what the parable is about and that is not what it means. To make such an inference would be an example of attributing meaning beyond what is intended, and yet people make that mistake all the time. How often have you heard criticism of the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son over how he must have treated the elder son? But the father represents our Heavenly Father! That is not what the parable is about and the criticism is out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a bigger problem with the parables than inferring beyond what they teach and it is this, which Jesus explained to his disciples in the context of the parable of the sower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:10-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this be right? That the reason Jesus spoke in parables was to inhibit understanding? Didn&amp;rsquo;t he come to seek and save the lost? What could this possibly mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus continued by quoting Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will indeed hear but never understand,
and you will indeed see but never perceive.” For this people&amp;rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/the-elephant-in-the-room/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;I have wrestled with this prophecy of Isaiah before&lt;/a&gt;. But here I have noticed something significant. Read carefully Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s original prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And [the voice of the Lord] said, “Go, and say to this people: ‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’ Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 6:9-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice of the Lord is full of imperatives. Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. Something is being done to this people and it is most uncomfortable. But Jesus is Lord of All, God before time, and fully able to clarify this. Notice how he quotes from Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this people&amp;rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:15a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of those unable to comprehend the parables has grown dull and they have closed their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is mystery here and grappling must continue. But in the grappling notice the grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:16-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, many have longed for what you have, for what you have received and seen and heard and understood. Are you sufficiently grateful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice too that the prophecy of Isaiah is not universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:13-14a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold on therefore to what you have, guard it jealously, and be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 3:1a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally notice how Jesus finished his parable of the persistent widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:8b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Lord receives your prayers into his golden bowls in the throne room of heaven, will he find faith on earth? Will you pray in faith? And will you keep praying, believing and not doubting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, always pray and do not lose heart, and be grateful for the love of the Father, that we should be called children of God! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The sacrifice of thanksgiving</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-sacrifice-of-thanksgiving/velizar-ivanov-V_Giq2h5jak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The sacrifice of thanksgiving" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you grateful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, joyously grateful to the one who has rescued you, redeemed you, blessed you, and given you hope and a future. Are you grateful to him with all your heart? It matters that you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 17:11-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten lepers were healed but only one was sufficiently grateful to return to Jesus, to thank him and to praise God. What did Jesus say to this one alone? “Your faith has made you well.” Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this leave us wondering, what of the others? Did they remain healed? We don&amp;rsquo;t know and we can&amp;rsquo;t know. I suspect the generosity of the Lord towards ungrateful sinners is that they did in fact remain healed. But really, shame on them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 9:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this what gratitude must be? Ensuring to thank the Lord with your whole heart as and when you receive blessing and healing and deliverance, with the expectation of further blessing to come? By no means! O my soul, you must not settle for such an impoverished understanding of thankfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul gives us a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-thessalonians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all circumstances you must give thanks, even acknowledging that some of these circumstances are hard to bear. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider David, fleeing for his life from Saul. Listen to his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts⸺the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:1, 4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound remotely like one who is receiving blessing and healing and deliverance? And yet,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in the midst of peril how does he end his psalm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 57:9-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something profound here which must be understood, and it is the nature of &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; in thanksgiving. Another psalmist articulates it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 116:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in times such as these that it is costly to give thanks, and yet it is precisely because of this that the thanksgiving becomes a sacrifice. The psalmist continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 116:15-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has he been saved or will his death imminently become precious in the sight of the Lord? It seems somewhat ambiguous to me. Is this why his thanksgiving is a sacrifice? Perhaps he will not even survive the time of crisis and yet still he gives thanks to God. This is the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and it is costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, I know your heartbreak and your longing. In these you must give thanks. And yes, that is so very painful, but you simply must. Be encouraged by the words of the Apostle Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There remain two observations still to be made and it is vital that they be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that giving thanks &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a situation of pain and grief and heartbreak is not giving thanks &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; these things, in some kind of passive-aggressive “thank you for hurting me” way. But it is never too difficult to find something truly worthy of thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:3-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this surely remains a sacrifice of thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second may seem to be quite close to “thank-you for hurting me”, but in fact it is not. It is the place where joy and sorrow meet and are inextricably intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O sons and daughters dearly loved, know that your Heavenly Father is so deeply invested in you there is nothing he won&amp;rsquo;t do for your eternal good. And some of these things are painful indeed to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the most painful experience, offer up to God your sacrifice of thanksgiving for such commitment and investment that he has made in you, that he will see through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph speaks the word of the Lord to those who may have forgotten this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 50:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, offer up to the Lord your sacrifice of thanksgiving however much you are hurting! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
