        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/chris-meads-VDHn0YmjIw4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The open door" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does an open door constitute a reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‚ÄòThe words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòI know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:7-8a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the seven churches only Smyrna was able to join with Philadelphia in being commended by Jesus without reservation. Jesus knew their works. What a joy it must have been for him to commend their faithfulness and to richly reward them. So let&amp;rsquo;s consider the reward of that open door. And let&amp;rsquo;s start by asking, how does that even constitute a reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t an open door simply an opportunity presenting itself? Indeed Paul uses exactly this metaphor on several occasions. Here are two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 16:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison‚∏∫that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 4:2-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly the opportunity here was not presenting itself but rather was being presented as a sovereign work of the Lord. Paul was most concerned about the open door for declaring the mystery of Christ, that he may make it clear‚∏∫of course he was. But I am not persuaded that this was the nature of the reward for the Philadelphians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Jesus&amp;rsquo; next letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not knocking on the Philadelphian door because it is already open and he is right there among them. This is the door to heaven itself, just as John&amp;rsquo;s vision continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‚ÄúCome up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.‚Äù At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a door this is! And it is wide open and cannot be shut. What a reward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In passing we must enjoy to notice John&amp;rsquo;s ludicrous attempt to describe the indescribable, the one seated on the throne. He who was seated there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. Really? Is that the best he could have done? It tells us nothing. Except of course of the ineffability of the Creator God of the Universe, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. Praise his holy name! And praise his indescribable being!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we continue to think about that door, let&amp;rsquo;s consider what was being rewarded, for it seems to be so very little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you have kept my word about patient endurance &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:8b, 10a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the entirety of it! But make no mistake, this is not so very little at all. We need to understand what this means, to keep Jesus&amp;rsquo; word and not to deny his name. It is in fact about absolute trust and complete surrender and living an uncompromised life which is fully consistent and perfectly aligned with Jesus being Lord of all. And it is about that personal holiness which is an ongoing act of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; name is his character. It is who he is. So what would deny his name? Would it not be anxiety or doubt or inconsistency or pretence or pride or holding anything back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you understand the magnitude of what was being commended? Marvel at it, and now go and do likewise! And if you think you simply lack the strength to live like this, observe that the Philadelphians also had but little power. The power to live like this is all the Lord&amp;rsquo;s and it is his gift of grace. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to this open door. Jesus tells us a bit more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Jesus again said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 10:7-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the door, and he is the door to life itself. Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. O my soul, are you starting to understand the magnitude of the Philadelphian reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is something else which must not be overlooked. What does Jesus say of those who have not lived this pure and holy and surrendered life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and they will learn that I have loved you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:9b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, have you learnt this? Have you learnt that the King of the Universe has loved you with an everlasting love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, do not overlook that the abundant life is this life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 3:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, live like those Philadelphians, and receive from Jesus the reward of that open door! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Small victories?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/small-victories/robert-collins-tvc5imO5pXk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Small victories?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that the smallest things are in fact the most important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s notice something in Jesus&amp;rsquo; letter to the church in Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‚ÄòThe words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú‚ÄòI know where you dwell, where Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 2:12-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Pergamum was dominated by worship of pagan deities and so the church there was right in the thick of the spiritual battle. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus&amp;rsquo; commendation seem to be of such a small thing? Simply holding fast his name? Is that all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not underestimate what such apparently small things are ultimately all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of forgiving a brother in Christ who has caused much pain, Paul writes this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/2-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 2:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, are you obedient in everything? Even in apparently small things? Let&amp;rsquo;s consider just one such. Recall something Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:27-28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not an area which requires honest self-evaluation and ruthless self-discipline? And isn&amp;rsquo;t this precisely one of these apparently small things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider. As you drive through the student quarter on a balmy summer afternoon, are you noticing the oh-so-attractive and rather scantily clad students parading themselves? And what do your eyes do then? And where do your thoughts take you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what your eyes are doing, because no-one sees? And where your thoughts are taking you, because no-one knows? It matters! Our Heavenly Father sees and our Heavenly Father knows. The choice between looking to the left or looking to the right is in fact the choice between disobedience and disrespect, or personal holiness and an act of worship. An act of worship to the one who loves you. The one who rescued you. The one who grieves over the vestigial sin in your life. O my soul, choose to honour him in this! Make every small victory over sin an act of worship, and keep your eyes to the right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the contexts of giving and praying and fasting, Jesus follows up with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:4, 6, 18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David knew this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-chronicles&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Chronicles 28:9a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every plan. Every thought. And the intent behind each and every thought. Every motive which wanted to remain hidden is in fact fully exposed to the Lord who searches all hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding fast Jesus&amp;rsquo; name is in truth all about consistency and integrity in the secret heart. Do you realise your character is the product of a thousand seemingly insignificant choices? You simply cannot do one thing and become another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 3:1-4, 17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must also take heed of Jesus&amp;rsquo; sharp two-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 4:12-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, notice that Antipas chose martyrdom rather than deny Jesus. And his reward? To bear the same description as of Jesus himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 1:4-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the faithful witness and he bestowed upon Antipas the very same title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, be ruthlessly consistent in how you approach all these apparently small things, and be Jesus&amp;rsquo; faithful witness in everything! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
