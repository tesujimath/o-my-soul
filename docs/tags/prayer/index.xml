&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t the parable of the persistent widow just so very uncomfortable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’” And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says. And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:1-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man, who only gave the widow what she was asking for to stop her bothering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke tells us precisely why Jesus told this parable, that we should persist in prayer and not lose heart. The parable provides insight into this. The persistent widow is me, crying out to God day and night, and the unrighteous judge is God himself⸺Father, Creator, Lord of All. And here&amp;rsquo;s what is so uncomfortable, so jarring. The character representing God in this parable is an unrighteous judge who cared only that the widow stop bothering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how the Lord receives the prayers of his beloved ones, our prayers? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first see how precious to the Lord are the prayers of his saints, us, our prayers. And for that we must look into the throne room of heaven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:6-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Lamb who was slain, the risen Lord Jesus, with eyes like a flame of fire, feet like burnished bronze, a voice like the roar of many waters, and his face like the sun shining in full strength. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here in the throne room around the Lamb are the twenty-four elders holding those golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints⸺our prayers. What next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 8:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how precious to the Lord are the prayers of the saints. They are offered on the golden altar before the throne in heaven, and are a pleasing aroma to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would be a terrible mistake to infer something of the character of God from the unrighteous judge in the parable. That is not what the parable is about and that is not what it means. To make such an inference would be an example of attributing meaning beyond what is intended, and yet people make that mistake all the time. How often have you heard criticism of the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son over how he must have treated the elder son? But the father represents our Heavenly Father! That is not what the parable is about and the criticism is out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a bigger problem with the parables than inferring beyond what they teach and it is this, which Jesus explained to his disciples in the context of the parable of the sower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:10-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this be right? That the reason Jesus spoke in parables was to inhibit understanding? Didn&amp;rsquo;t he come to seek and save the lost? What could this possibly mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus continued by quoting Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will indeed hear but never understand,
and you will indeed see but never perceive.” For this people&amp;rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/the-elephant-in-the-room/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;I have wrestled with this prophecy of Isaiah before&lt;/a&gt;. But here I have noticed something significant. Read carefully Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s original prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And [the voice of the Lord] said, “Go, and say to this people: ‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’ Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 6:9-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice of the Lord is full of imperatives. Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. Something is being done to this people and it is most uncomfortable. But Jesus is Lord of All, God before time, and fully able to clarify this. Notice how he quotes from Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this people&amp;rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:15a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of those unable to comprehend the parables has grown dull and they have closed their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is mystery here and grappling must continue. But in the grappling notice the grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:16-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, many have longed for what you have, for what you have received and seen and heard and understood. Are you sufficiently grateful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice too that the prophecy of Isaiah is not universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:13-14a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold on therefore to what you have, guard it jealously, and be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 3:1a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally notice how Jesus finished his parable of the persistent widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:8b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Lord receives your prayers into his golden bowls in the throne room of heaven, will he find faith on earth? Will you pray in faith? And will you keep praying, believing and not doubting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, always pray and do not lose heart, and be grateful for the love of the Father, that we should be called children of God! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do you want me to do for you?</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/what-do-you-want-me-to-do-for-you/jj-ying-9Qwbfa_RM94-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What do you want me to do for you?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you told Jesus what you want him to do for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in ambition or covetousness or grasping or self-interest, and neither is he, but rather life and health and strength and deliverance and mercy. Have you told him what you want him to do for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As [Jesus] drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:35-41a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this interesting? “What do you want me to do for you?” This question was asked by the Word of Life himself, the omniscient Creator God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 1:1-5, 14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus already knew this blind man whose name was Bartimaeus. He knew his hopes and his dreams and his heartbreak and the debilitating affliction of his blindness. He was and is the giver of life itself, the one who knows and the one who loves and the one who heals, and yet, “What do you want me to do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Jesus ask this? Consider Bartimaeus&amp;rsquo; answer and what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.”  And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:41b-43&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much faith is articulated in that simple request, “Lord, let me recover my sight”? O my soul, if you would receive from Jesus you must believe. A previous encounter with two other blind men teaches us this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.” When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.” And their eyes were opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 9:27-30a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, according to your faith be it done to you. Even if you are that desperate father of the boy with the unclean spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can!’ All things are possible for one who believes.” Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 9:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want Jesus to do for you? If you believe that he can, you must ask him. Did Jesus not say as much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 7:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we finish, there&amp;rsquo;s something to notice from the context of the account of Bartimaeus&amp;rsquo; healing in Luke&amp;rsquo;s gospel. Do not overlook that the Bible was written under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit. It is hugely significant how the various accounts were assembled, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what else Luke put together here in what later became Chapter Eighteen of his gospel. There are five preceding paragraphs and they are all so very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the parable of the persistent widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, don&amp;rsquo;t give up telling Jesus what you want him to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must ask Jesus as one crying out for mercy. You deserve nothing, so repudiate that spirit of entitlement which is always so eager to raise its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is of the little children whom the disciples rebuked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:16-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/receiving-the-kingdom-of-god-like-a-little-child/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;be that little child and depend on Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. Has there ever been such an age as ours of rugged individualism? When Jesus asks, “What do you want me to do for you?” would you reply, “Ah, I&amp;rsquo;m alright thanks Jesus, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth is the tragic story of the rich young ruler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus &amp;hellip; said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:22-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, you must want Jesus and his Kingdom above all else. And do not overlook what Jesus said next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do not hold back in what you ask Jesus to do for you, even if it seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fifth and final and by far the most important is Jesus again telling his disciples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:31-33&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, the very Son of God poured out his life for you on that cross at Calvary, and today and every day he pours out his love. His death paid in full both your own debt and that of all humankind. His resurrection is victory over sin and death and all that drags you down. Praise, O my soul, the King of Heaven!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartimaeus did not hold back in telling Jesus what he wanted him to do for him, and neither must you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.” And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:41-43&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when all the people see what Jesus does for humble sinners who ask in faith, believing and not doubting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, believe and do not doubt, and tell Jesus the full extent of what you want him to do for you! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
