        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/love-marks-the-spot/suhash-villuri-DYWHwLZyJ64-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love marks the spot" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you find the way to that treasure in heaven yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ought to have done so because it&amp;rsquo;s not well hidden and you have a map. But if perhaps you are thinking that X marks the spot you would be wrong. For it is in fact love which marks the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And behold, a man came up to [Jesus], saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn a lesson from this likeable young man, for many make similar mistakes and he made several, and there&amp;rsquo;s one right here in the first thing he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What good deed must I do to have eternal life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good deed? In the singular? Just one? Will that be enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And [Jesus] said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honour your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:17-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has quoted only six of the Ten Commandments. He skipped the first four. Why would he do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the context in which the Lord introduced the Ten Commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And God spoke all these words, saying, “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commandments were given to the Israelites by their rescuer and redeemer who had every right to command obedience⸺the one who is also our own rescuer and redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the four commandments which Jesus skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You shall have no other gods before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:3-4,7a,8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll come to Jesus&amp;rsquo; skipping⸺or as we&amp;rsquo;ll see, not skipping⸺over these headline commandments. But before we do that, let&amp;rsquo;s notice his rephrasing of the tenth commandment. Listen to the continuation as originally given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not commit adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall not covet your neighbour&amp;rsquo;s house; you shall not covet your neighbour&amp;rsquo;s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbour&amp;rsquo;s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:12-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honour your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:18b-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus restated the commandment not to covet as, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting! Why would he do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was unwrapping the commandment to reveal the full extent of its reach, which is far more than its original hearers had understood, and far more than any of us have understood. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that his main point in the Sermon on the Mount?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice too the young man&amp;rsquo;s eagerness to claim obedience to these and how Jesus gently exposed his shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man hadn&amp;rsquo;t remotely kept these commandments and as such was so much like us. So Jesus simply showed him the full extent of “love your neighbour as yourself” until the young man understood his shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was his failure to love revealed but suddenly too were his idols exposed. For what was it that defined him? What was he living for? What had he built his life upon? Jesus showed him and he went away sorrowful. What a tragic figure he was, and how very much like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For are we ourselves not overflowing in material wealth in our western affluence? Are we not rich like that tragic young man?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:23-26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clearly impossible for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, notwithstanding the weasel words of reinterpretation imposed upon this verse by commentators throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hear Jesus&amp;rsquo; words, and cry out in gratitude and adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:26b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what about Jesus&amp;rsquo; skipping over the first four commandments? Are these not in fact the more important, for it is these which concern our relationship with our Heavenly Father, which must surely come ahead of our relationships with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 12:28-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So notice how Jesus returns to exactly this in our passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:27-30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not in fact precisely the commandment? Have no other gods before the Lord, and worship no idols. Put the Lord ahead of houses and brothers and sisters and father and mother and children and lands. And is Jesus not doing for us precisely what he did for that young man when he showed him how completely and comprehensively he had failed to understand “love your neighbour as yourself”, but now in the context of “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these verses are addressed also to us. Have we actually understood “You shall have no other gods before me”? How the idols creep in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, what is it that you have you placed ahead of the Lord? Gently and firmly and unequivocally Jesus says repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a return on that investment you can expect! A hundredfold! So do not hold back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, love the Lord with all of your being, and your neighbour as yourself, and you shall have treasure in heaven, a hundredfold of what you surrender for the Kingdom! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to be rich</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 06:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/how-to-be-rich/dan-dennis-pZ56pVKd_6c-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to be rich" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to be rich? Really rich? It is desperately important to be so, because otherwise you will have nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And [Jesus] said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one&amp;rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’” But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:15-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is about being rich towards God. What did you think I was asking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encountered this parable last week in the context of being looked after by our Heavenly Father but we didn&amp;rsquo;t adequately consider being rich towards God, so let&amp;rsquo;s do that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s begin with Jesus&amp;rsquo; own commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:15a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To covet means to long to possess, and not only what belongs to others. Coveting one&amp;rsquo;s own possessions is a perennial snare to the one who would be rich towards God, for such coveting creates treasures on earth in blatant disregard of Jesus&amp;rsquo; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:19-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How tragic to convert a potential asset for the Kingdom into the casualty of moth and rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what else did Jesus say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:33-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is again. Your possessions are assets for the Kingdom, and they wholly belong to the King. So use them for Kingdom work and you will be rich with treasure in heaven which is immune to both moth and rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who live in modern Western affluence must be particularly vigilant. For ours is a culture of rugged individualism and indifference towards those in need. O my soul, beware lest you make your benchmark that of the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jesus&amp;rsquo; warning continues into the parable of the master returning from the wedding feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:35-36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is surely about living lives consistent with what we have received, and at all times. We won&amp;rsquo;t get into this now, except to notice a portent for any who would excuse their own lack of concern for others by using the benchmark of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And that servant who knew his master&amp;rsquo;s will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 12:47-48&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus expects far more of those within the church than those without. Of course he does! We who have so richly received and who know his will, how then could we hold back in blessing others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/james&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;James 2:14-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead, no less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And know that loving one another has a high cost. Will you bear it? It helps to remember the cost which was borne for you at Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world&amp;rsquo;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&amp;rsquo;s love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 3:16-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do what pleases God in loving one another and in every other way and you will be rich beyond imagining! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The open door</title>
        <link>https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 06:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://omysoul.faith/the-open-door/chris-meads-VDHn0YmjIw4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The open door" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;O my soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does an open door constitute a reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‘The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:7-8a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the seven churches only Smyrna was able to join with Philadelphia in being commended by Jesus without reservation. Jesus knew their works. What a joy it must have been for him to commend their faithfulness and to richly reward them. So let&amp;rsquo;s consider the reward of that open door. And let&amp;rsquo;s start by asking, how does that even constitute a reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t an open door simply an opportunity presenting itself? Indeed Paul uses exactly this metaphor on several occasions. Here are two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/1-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 16:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison⸺that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 4:2-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly the opportunity here was not presenting itself but rather was being presented as a sovereign work of the Lord. Paul was most concerned about the open door for declaring the mystery of Christ, that he may make it clear⸺of course he was. But I am not persuaded that this was the nature of the reward for the Philadelphians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Jesus&amp;rsquo; next letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not knocking on the Philadelphian door because it is already open and he is right there among them. This is the door to heaven itself, just as John&amp;rsquo;s vision continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a door this is! And it is wide open and cannot be shut. What a reward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In passing we must enjoy to notice John&amp;rsquo;s ludicrous attempt to describe the indescribable, the one seated on the throne. He who was seated there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. Really? Is that the best he could have done? It tells us nothing. Except of course of the ineffability of the Creator God of the Universe, reigning and ruling in majesty and splendour. Praise his holy name! And praise his indescribable being!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we continue to think about that door, let&amp;rsquo;s consider what was being rewarded, for it seems to be so very little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you have kept my word about patient endurance &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:8b, 10a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the entirety of it! But make no mistake, this is not so very little at all. We need to understand what this means, to keep Jesus&amp;rsquo; word and not to deny his name. It is in fact about absolute trust and complete surrender and living an uncompromised life which is fully consistent and perfectly aligned with Jesus being Lord of all. And it is about that personal holiness which is an ongoing act of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; name is his character. It is who he is. So what would deny his name? Would it not be anxiety or doubt or inconsistency or pretence or pride or holding anything back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, do you understand the magnitude of what was being commended? Marvel at it, and now go and do likewise! And if you think you simply lack the strength to live like this, observe that the Philadelphians also had but little power. The power to live like this is all the Lord&amp;rsquo;s and it is his gift of grace. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to this open door. Jesus tells us a bit more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 10:7-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the door, and he is the door to life itself. Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. O my soul, are you starting to understand the magnitude of the Philadelphian reward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is something else which must not be overlooked. What does Jesus say of those who have not lived this pure and holy and surrendered life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and they will learn that I have loved you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 3:9b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, have you learnt this? Have you learnt that the King of the Universe has loved you with an everlasting love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, do not overlook that the abundant life is this life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 3:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O my soul, live like those Philadelphians, and receive from Jesus the reward of that open door! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
