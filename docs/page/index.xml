        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O my Soul&lt;/em&gt; is words of encouragement for anyone who has chosen to surrender their life to Jesus⸺for anyone on that long journey of dying to self and living wholly for the Lord, loving him and loving those he brings onto our path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways these words are merely a continuation of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Letters to Amy&lt;/a&gt;, my gift of love and encouragement to that faithful servant of the Lord, written while she was living in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea, and which concluded when she returned to New Zealand.  I found such grace and blessing for my own heart from the Lord even as I wrote that I find I have to continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is such joy in this surrendered life but it can be hard and it can be lonely.  So here is encouragement to persevere and to walk worthy.  May the Lord bless each one who comes this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 16:24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Scripture references are quoted from the ESV unless otherwise indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O my Soul&lt;/em&gt; is also available as a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone on this journey of loving the Lord and surrendering their life to Jesus is welcome to join the discussion in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/community/&#34; &gt;O my Soul community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://signal.group/#CjQKILv1dPk0-Q3TXxS3IxEK5ukZmuYUVdCyJ2jmFxj_6N0LEhCjJT_KXvGIOpLutcBLdQ01&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;community on Signal&lt;/a&gt; for discussion of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omysoul.faith/about/&#34; &gt;O my Soul&lt;/a&gt; and related matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a community for those who worship the Christian God of the Bible.  It is a place to find encouragement and affirmation and blessing and healing.  It is a place to be gentle and kind.  It is a safe place for hurting people.  It is a place to reflect on how you have been blessed or encouraged by the writing here, or to share struggles you have experienced in living this out in practice.  It is a place to encourage and affirm one another in these struggles as we journey on for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a community for arguing or taking offence at others or for discussion of other gods or other religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone on this journey of loving the Lord and surrendering their life to Jesus is welcome to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://signal.group/#CjQKILv1dPk0-Q3TXxS3IxEK5ukZmuYUVdCyJ2jmFxj_6N0LEhCjJT_KXvGIOpLutcBLdQ01&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;join the community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
