    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>O my soul,</p>
<p>Do you love your life?</p>
<p>Many do. But what does Jesus expect and require?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><p>“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.</p>
<p>“‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.’”</p>
</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/revelation"><cite>Revelation 2:8-9</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>Only two out of the seven churches are commended without rebuke, and Smyrna is one. Let&rsquo;s first notice how much the currency of heaven differs from that of the world. These faithful ones in Smyrna were suffering and impoverished and slandered, and yet regarded by Jesus as rich. Rejoice that the currency of heaven is not that of the world!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also notice that they were slandered by those falsely claiming to be Jews. Slander is speech which is injurious to another&rsquo;s good name. Jesus stands with and commends these slandered ones. And their accusers? A synagogue of Satan! Can you imagine a clearer or harsher or more final judgment? As in Ephesus, those seeming to hold and wield power were utterly rejected by him.</p>
<p>What could these faithful ones in Smyrna expect to receive for their patient endurance?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>‘Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.’</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/revelation"><cite>Revelation 2:10</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>Suffering. Prison. Even greater tribulation. And for some, death.</p>
<p>And this is a test! This time the test is not to endure years of waiting. This is a crisis time distilled into ten days, but let us not underestimate the severity of such testing.</p>
<p>The writer to the Hebrews tells us what was similarly faced by others so highly commended for their faith.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword.</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/hebrews"><cite>Hebrews 11:35-37</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>Is this the reward for faithfulness and patient endurance? By no means! The actual reward is clearly stated.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.”</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/revelation"><cite>Revelation 2:10b</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>O my soul, have you noticed that for each of the letters to the seven churches, Jesus introduces himself differently, and for each so pertinently to the situation found there.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.’”</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/revelation"><cite>Revelation 2:8</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t Jesus reminding those about to face death that that is not the end? Praise him for such grace and kindness and understanding!</p>
<p>Paul endured hardship and suffering and the prospect of death. What did he have to say?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honoured in my body, whether by life or by death.</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/philippians"><cite>Philippians 1:18b-20</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>Here is Paul rejoicing even in the face of the danger of death. And what is he most concerned about? That he will not be ashamed, that his courage will withstand, and that Christ may be honoured in his body, whether by life or by death!</p>
<p>How is this possible? He knew about that crown of life.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/philippians"><cite>Philippians 1:21-24</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>There is no death wish here, simply a crystal clear understanding of the joys that lie ahead in the heavenly realms. To die is gain, of course it is. To depart and be with Christ is far better. This must be fully understood! Observe and savour Paul&rsquo;s peace and lightness of spirit, that he is able to quip about choosing as if the choice were his own! And through the prayers of the Philippian Christians and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ he knows that this will turn out for his deliverance.</p>
<p>O my soul, do not neglect to pray for those facing such trials, that they may know the same, and know too that this is not something worth being anxious about.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?⁠</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/luke"><cite>Luke 12:25</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honour him.”</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/john"><cite>John 12:23-26</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>This challenges us to the very core of our faith, oh how it does! And in all this, do not be eager to make claims about how lightly you hold your own life. This is no easy matter. Peter, bless him, underestimated this.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.” Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/john"><cite>John 13:36-38</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>And he did, as we know. But listen again to Jesus and be encouraged.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>‘He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.’</p><span class="cite"><span>― </span><a href="/ref/revelation"><cite>Revelation 2:11</cite></a></span></blockquote>
<p>O my soul, do not love your life, but love the Lord and live for him alone, and look forward to receiving the crown of life, knowing that to live is Christ, and to die is gain! 🙏</p>
